\section{Discussion}
% Notes from Cahill
% Discuss your research questions in the same order you originally presented them.
% when interpreting, it is essential that you come back to the same ideas you laid out in your introduction, but now indicate how your results alter our understanding. If some ideas in your introduction don't get referred to in the discussion, they proably didn't belong in your intro
% You should extrapolate from your results one step, but no more than that. For example, if you found X, you can suggest Y. But you cannot say that since X is true, Y might be too, and therefore Z happens
