\section{Results}
% Notes from cahill
% For nearly every paper, this should be your shortest section. For a regular, ~20 page paper, the results of a tightly written paper with a strong story should be about 1 page (excluding tables/figures)
% use fewer figures and tables than you think you need. put the extras online. The problem with figures is that simple ones are more briefly stated with text, while complex ones take a long time to understand. The latter is fine if, and only if, they are directly related to your main research questions. If tables or figures are simply supportive, then putting them in the main paper will greatly subtract from your overall pitch.
% When discussing statistical results, focus on the answer to your research questions, not test statistics, P values, or AIC values. These are tools for interpretation, they are not meaninful in and of themselves. They are to be used to support your story
% answer your research questions in the same order you presented them
