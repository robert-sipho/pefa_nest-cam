Motion sensor camera traps are used extensively in the fields of zoology and ecology. Camera traps have been around for decades and have revolutionized wildlife research and conservation due to their ability to capture information with little expense, and minimal disturbance to the wildlife. Recently, the ability of computers to recognize certain aspects of images has led to the use of these techniques to save human time in examining the camera trap images. In this work object detection methods are applied to peregrine nest cameras. Our application of these techniques is able to achieve XX\% accuracy. Additionally due to the nature of the sequence of images taken, any mistakes made can be rectified by using a time-sequence of the data.
