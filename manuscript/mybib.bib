  abstract = {During recent decades there has been a change in the circulation of atmospheric pressure throughout the Northern Hemisphere. These variations are expressed in the recently described Arctic Oscillation (AO), which has shown an upward trend (associated with winter warming in the eastern Arctic) during the last three decades. We analysed a 12-year time series on growth of Cassiope tetragona (Lapland Cassiope) and a 21-year time series on abundance of a Svalbard reindeer population. High values of the AO index were associated with reduced plant growth and reindeer population growth rate. The North Atlantic Oscillation index was not able to explain a significant proportion of the variance in either plant growth or reindeer population fluctuations. Thus, the AO index may be a better predictor for ecosystem effects of climate change in certain high-arctic areas compared to the NAO index.},

(2) If removing species A in food web 1 causes a 20\% decrease in species B, can we assume that a similar decrease of B will occur if we remove species A in web 2, which contains a number of species not found in web 1? The answer to these sorts of questions depend a great deal on the importance of indirect interactions in food webs. If the effect of one species on the density of another tends to diminish with their separation in the food web (measured by number of feeding links in the shortest path connecting the two species), then it may be possible to ignore at least some indirect effects. Under this scenario where affects are attenuated by distance in the food web, we would expect either prey or predators of the focal species to be most affected by a change in the rate of harvest of the focal species.},

RFID is used to track animals and to collect information about movements and other behaviors, as well as to automate or improve husbandry. Disney's Animal Kingdom\textregistered{} uses passive RFID technology to monitor nest usage by a breeding colony of northern carmine bee-eaters. We implemented RFID technologies in various equipment configurations, initially deploying low-frequency (LF) 125\,kHz RFID and later changing to high-frequency (HF) 13.56\,MHz RFID technology, to monitor breeding behavior in the flock. We installed antennas connected to RFID readers at the entrances of nest tunnels to detect RFID transponders attached to leg bands as birds entered and exited tunnels. Both LF-RFID and HF-RFID systems allowed the characterization of nest visitation, including the timing of nest activity, breeding pair formation, identification of egg-laying females, participation by nonresidents, and detection of nest disruptions. However, we collected a substantially larger volume of data using the increased bandwidth and polling speed inherent with HF-RFID, which permitted tag capture of multiple birds simultaneously and resulted in fewer missed nest visits in comparison to LF-RFID. Herein, we describe the evolution of the RFID setups used to monitor nest usage for more than 7 years, the types of data that can be gained using RFID at nests, and how we used these data to gain insights into carmine bee-eater breeding behavior and improve husbandry.},

  abstract = {In environments such as arctic tundra, where bird densities are low and habitats are comparatively homogeneous, suitable nest sites likely are not limited. Under these conditions, reproductive success of birds may be determined by factors other than the habitat characteristics of nest sites. We studied the relative influence of nest habitat, food, nest distribution, and parental behavior on the reproductive success of tundra-breeding shorebirds at East Bay, Southampton Island, Nunavut, Canada. From 2000 to 2002, we monitored the nests of five species: Black-bellied Plover (Pluvialis squatarola), Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus), Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres), White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis), and Red Phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius). For each species, habitat differed between nest sites and random sites. In contrast, habitat differed between successful and failed nest sites only for White-rumped Sandpipers. Shorebirds did not prefer to nest in habitats where food was most abundant. Although nest success varied among species in all years, artificial nest experiments suggested that interspecific variation in predation rate was not related to habitat type. Instead, the marked interspecific variation in nest success may have been related to incubation behavior. Species taking fewer incubation recesses had higher nest success, although these results should be viewed as preliminary. The factor with the greatest interannual influence on nest success was fluctuating predation pressure, apparently related to the abundance of predators and lemmings.},

  abstract = {Although animal population dynamics have often been correlated with fluctuations in precipitation, causal relationships have rarely been demonstrated in wild birds. We combined nest observations with a field experiment to investigate the direct effect of rainfall on survival of peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) nestlings in the Canadian Arctic. We then used historical data to evaluate if recent changes in the precipitation regime could explain the long-term decline of falcon annual productivity. Rainfall directly caused more than one-third of the recorded nestling mortalities. Juveniles were especially affected by heavy rainstorms ({$\geq$}8 mm/day). Nestlings sheltered from rainfall by a nest box had significantly higher survival rates. We found that the increase in the frequency of heavy rain over the last three decades is likely an important factor explaining the recent decline in falcon nestling survival rates, and hence the decrease in annual breeding productivity of the population. Our study is among the first experimental demonstrations of the direct link between rainfall and survival in wild birds, and clearly indicates that top arctic predators can be significantly impacted by changes in precipitation regime.},

In Svalbard, we compared nest densities and nesting success in these two environments over ten breeding seasons to assess the impact of spring snow cover, food availability to nesting adults and arctic fox Vulpes lagopus (main terrestrial predator) abundance. In years with extensive spring snow cover, fewer geese at both colonies attempted to breed, possibly because snow cover limited pre-nesting feeding opportunities, leaving adults in poor breeding condition. Nesting success at the steep cliff colony was lower with extensive spring snow cover; such conditions force birds to commit to repeated and prolonged recess periods at far distant feeding areas, leaving nests open to predation. By contrast, nesting success at the open tundra slope was not affected by spring snow cover; even if birds were apparently in poor condition they could feed immediately adjacent to their nests and defend them from predators. Foxes were the main nest predator in the open tundra slopes but avian predators likely had a larger impact at the steep cliffs colony. Thus, the relative inaccessibility of the cliffs habitat may bring protection from foxes but also deprives geese from readily accessing feeding areas, with the best prospects for successful nesting in low spring snow cover years. Our findings indicate that spring snow cover, predator abundance and food proximity did not uniformly influence nesting success of this herbivore, and their effects were dependent on nesting habitat choice.},

  abstract = {The population of willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) in the Lower Kolyma district of Yakutia, USSR, shows cycles of abundance with a period of about 10 years. Observations have been made for 2-5 months each year since 1977. This paper attempts to explain why the period of population depression is so long (3-4 years) and why the peak population density is so high. In "normal" years birds occupied only the 3\%-4\% of the whole area that consisted of preferred biotope, while during the population peak the less preferred "placour tundra" was also occupied. The most important factor affecting population numbers was the proportion of non-breeding birds, which ranged from 62\% in 1981 (population peak) to close to zero in 1979. The high proportion of non-breeding birds in 1980 and 1981 was preceded by deficient winter diets and poor spring nutrition. When the birds arrive at their breeding grounds they defend a territory, which enables them to compensate for winter weight loss and gain condition for breeding. There was a strong negative correlation between territory size and willow biomass density (an index of territory quality). In preferred biotopes birds used only about 8\%-12\% of resource annually, but the less preferred biotopes were used very intensively. Probably the periodical high peaks and long troughs in willow grouse numbers can be explained as follows. For 2 or 3 years birds can use vast areas with only a low density of suitable food to support reproduction. When these resources are exhausted they take a long time to recover. Meanwhile the grouse population is restricted to patches where with willows abundant, of varying quality, and only a few of them (less than 1\% of the total area) may permanently support a high density of willow grouse.},

  abstract = {Numerous experimental studies providing extra food have concluded that food availability at the beginning of the breeding season constrains the start of egg-laying for female birds (Food Supply Hypothesis) because supplemented females usually lay earlier than nonsupplemented ones. This conclusion has recently been questioned because food addition studies may be confounded by ordered habitat selection. Ordered habitat selection occurs when territories or nests provided with extra food are chosen by individuals of higher quality that may be able to initiate breeding early, regardless of food supply (Habitat Selection Hypothesis). To test these two hypotheses, we performed an experiment using the Lesser Kestrel (Falco naumanni). To reveal effects of ordered habitat selection, extra food was provided to half of the nests in two colonies in which the other nests remained unsupplemented (mixed colonies). We provided extra food to all nests in two colonies (allfed colonies) and to no nests in three colonies (all-unfed colonies). In these colonies, ordered habitat selection could not occur because all nests received equal treatment. In mixed colonies, fed pairs laid earlier than unfed ones. In contrast to the prediction of the Habitat Selection Hypothesis, there was no significant difference in mean laying date between unfed pairs of mixed colonies and pairs in all-unfed colonies, or between fed pairs of mixed colonies and pairs in all-fed colonies. Moreover, laying date was significantly earlier in all-fed than in all-unfed colonies. Therefore, the results support the Food Supply Hypothesis and refute the Habitat Selection Hypothesis.},

Nestlings at the northern extreme of the range in Alaska had slower growth rates, lower body mass, and higher residual body mass than nestlings in New York and Tennessee. High insect availability was correlated with increased growth rates of nestlings in New York and Tennessee, but not in Alaska. Conversely, nestlings in Alaska showed increased residual body mass with high insect availability, but nestlings in New York and Tennessee did not. The trade-off between growth rate and residual body mass varied among sites, with fast-growing nestlings in Tennessee maintaining a higher residual body mass than those in Alaska. These results suggest that factors affecting offspring growth and condition vary among sites, leading to geographical differences in offspring development trajectories.},

  abstract = {This review examines the direct effects of climate change on insect herbivores. Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor directly affecting herbivorous insects. There is little evidence of any direct effects of CO2 or UVB. Direct impacts of precipitation have been largely neglected in current research on climate change. Temperature directly affects development, survival, range and abundance. Species with a large geographical range will tend to be less affected. The main effect of temperature in temperate regions is to influence winter survival; at more northerly latitudes, higher temperatures extend the summer season, increasing the available thermal budget for growth and reproduction. Photoperiod is the dominant cue for the seasonal synchrony of temperate insects, but their thermal requirements may differ at different times of year. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature determine phenology; the two factors do not necessarily operate in tandem. Insect herbivores show a number of distinct life-history strategies to exploit plants with different growth forms and strategies, which will be differentially affected by climate warming. There are still many challenges facing biologists in predicting and monitoring the impacts of climate change. Future research needs to consider insect herbivore phenotypic and genotypic flexibility, their responses to global change parameters operating in concert, and awareness that some patterns may only become apparent in the longer term.},

  abstract = {Companion studies of Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) in the central Yukon from 1978 to 1983 allowed us to examine Gyrfalcon reproductive performance at 14 nest sites in relation to ptarmigan abundance and other potential effects, including weather variables, the previous year's success, nest site characteristics, and Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) nesting density. Ptarmigan abundance declined six-fold and was mirrored by a significant decline in Gyrfalcon breeding success (breeding failure 58\%, clutch desertion 33\%). Clutch size showed little variation, although deserted nests held fewer eggs than did successful nests, and there were more four-egg clutches when ptarmigan were most abundant. An average of 2.26 young fledged per nest during abundant ptarmigan years, and 0.l8 when ptarmigan were declining. No other factors were correlated with Gyrfalcon reproductive success. Juvenile ptarmigan density had a compensatory effect: even when ptarmigan breeding numbers dipped, Gyrfalcons bred successfully if the proportion of juvenile ptarmigan was high. Clutch initiation date was a good predictor of Gyrfalcon breeding performance. Early clutches had more eggs (67\% with 4 eggs compared to 27\% in late nests), were less likely to be deserted (5\% vs. 59\%), and fledged more young (93\% vs. 38\%). Two Gyrfalcon pairs, supplemented with food in a poor ptarmigan year, fledged young at a rate and schedule comparable to pairs during a peak ptarmigan year. We discuss interesting observations about Gyrfalcon brood success, as well as Golden Eagle nesting density as a potentially important aspect of the reproductive ecology of Gyrfalcons in this population.

  abstract = {Understanding multiple challenges that restrict conservation success is a central task of applied ecology, especially when resources are limited and actions are expensive, such as with reintroduction programs. Simultaneous consideration of multiple hypotheses can expedite identification of factors that most limit conservation success. Since 2001, reintroduction of a migratory population of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) has been under way in eastern North America. Hatching success, however, has been extremely low. In our study area, in and near Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central Wisconsin, USA, we simultaneously tested 3 hypotheses explaining poor hatching success: harassment of incubating birds by black flies (Simuliidae), effects of captivity, and inexperience of breeders. When black flies were experimentally suppressed, hatching probability doubled. Daily nest survival for Whooping Cranes was strongly and negatively related to an index of black fly abundance, particularly of Simulium annulus. Daily nest survival was negatively but only weakly related to the number of generations that ancestors of breeding Whooping Cranes had been in captivity and was not related to nesting experience. We also examined whether Whooping Cranes were nesting later to avoid stress from black flies. Phenology shifted earlier with more growing degree days and greater nesting experience and was only weakly related to year. Overall, improved hatching success did not lead to better reproductive success. Although effects of black flies on hatching success can be mitigated through management, such actions would not be adequate to generate satisfactory population growth. Recognition of this limitation was hastened through experimentation.},

In this study, we investigate whether repeat colour digital photography can be used (1) to identify phenological patterns, (2) to identify differences in vegetation due to experimental warming and site moisture conditions, and (3) as a proxy for biomass. Pixel values (RGB) were extracted from images taken of permanent plots in long-term warming experiments in three tundra communities at a high Arctic site during one growing season. The Greenness Excess Index (GEI) was calculated from image data at the plot scale (1 \texttimes{} 1 m) as well as for two species, Dryas integrifolia and Salix arctica. GEI values were then compared to corresponding field-based phenology observations. GEI and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from a paired set of true colour and infrared images were compared with biomass data. The GEI values followed seasonal phenology at the plot and species scale and correlated well with standardized observations. GEI correlated well with biomass and was able to detect quantitative differences between warmed and control plots and the differences between communities due to site-specific moisture conditions. We conclude that true colour images can be used effectively to monitor phenology and biomass in high Arctic tundra. The simplicity and affordability of the photographic method represents an opportunity to expand observations in tundra ecosystems.},

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) overcomes some of the drawbacks associated with measuring haematocrits and therefore should be a better condition index. We investigated the relationship between these blood parameters and the breeding performances of great skuas Catharacta skua. As predicted from activity budgets of the sexes, male MCVs were significantly positively correlated with hatch date and the MCVs of both sexes were negatively correlated with the number of chicks fledged. No correlations existed between these breeding parameters and haematocrit. Since males provision females and chicks, they probably influence breeding performance via foraging abilities, whereas in females nutritional investment may be more important. This is the first study of a free-living/ nondomesticated vertebrate population in which these kinds of relationship have been demonstrated and we conclude that MCV is a useful measure of condition.},

  abstract = {We studied sex-dependent mass growth of chicks of the monomorphic common tern Sterna hirundo which fledged at a colony site in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, between 1997 and 1999. Brood size, brood mates' sex and hatching order (a-, b- and c-chicks) were known for many individuals, which were sexed by molecular techniques. Daily growth rates and age of fledging were independent of sex. However, in all years male chicks reached higher peak mass and fledged up to 5.2\% heavier than female chicks. Broods with at least two fledglings showed that besides sex, brood size interacting with sex composition affected chick mass. In mixed broods, brothers had higher peak and pre-fledging mass than sisters they were reared with. Especially in the combination a-daughter and b-son the brothers were heavier. Lowest mass was found in broods with three nest mates of the same sex. A detailed study of 24 threefledgling broods showed that male c-chicks were heavier than their siblings. The results reveal an advantage for chicks in mixed broods, especially for sons, and more especially if the son was a c-chick. Higher mass and possibly dominance of sons in c-position might be related to higher maternal androgen levels, which are known to increase with each egg laid. The results suggest that even in a monomorphic species, sons might be more expensive to rear, and are discussed with respect to sibling competition, parental effort, survival of sons, as well as to fitness benefits favoring parents producing sons.},

Growth models were fitted to a total of 16,650 weight\textendash age data belonging to 2071 lambs. Five nonlinear growth functions of von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, Brody, Logistic, and Richards and two linear polynomial functions were applied. The growth models were compared by using the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and residual mean square (MSE). Among all nonlinear fixed effect models, the Brody function had the smallest AIC and MSE values, indicating the best fit for both sexes. The Brody fixed effect model compared with NLMM including one random effect of asymptotic mature weight. The model evaluation criteria indicated that the Brody mixed effect model fitted the data better than the corresponding fixed effect model. It can be concluded that, among the linear models, the polynomial of the third order and, among nonlinear models, Brody mixed model were found to best fit the Baluchi sheep growth data.},

We focus on the spring phenology of populations because it is highly responsive to climate change and easy to document across a wide range of species. We show that evolution can be fast and can occur at the time scale of a few decades. We present an example of reproductive phenological change associated with climate change (North American red squirrels in the Yukon), where a detailed analysis of quantitative genetic parameters demonstrates contemporary evolution. We answer a series of frequently asked questions that should help biologists less familiar with evolutionary theory and quantitative genetic methods to think about the role of evolution in current responses of ecological systems to climate change. Our conclusion is that evolution by natural selection is a pertinent force to consider even at the time scale of contemporary climate changes. However, all species may not be equal in their capacity to benefit from contemporary evolution.},

Yet the steps leading from ecological description and understanding to reliable projection are rarely explicit. A good understanding of the factors which allow the ecological effects of climate change to be effectively anticipated is critical to both the quality of basic science and its application to public policy. We used research performed on mammals to explore scientific approaches to anticipation of climate change effects. We distinguished forecasting models based on correlations from predictive models based on cause-effect relationships. These categories represent extremes along a continuous gradient between pattern description and causal understanding. We suggest that the constraints to our capacity to anticipate fall into 6 broad categories rooted in the development and application of forecasting and predictive models. These categories help to identify the conditions that allow or prevent projection of the effects of climate change on ecosystems. This approach should also help to identify which research avenues will likely be most fruitful.},

We used data collected over two complete lemming cycles to investigate how fluctuations in lemming density were associated with nesting success of greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus) in the Canadian High Arctic. We tested predictions of the APH and NAH for geese breeding at low and high densities. Goose nesting success varied from 22\% to 91\% between years and the main egg predator was the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus). Nesting associations with snowy owls (Nyctea scandiaca) were observed but only during peak lemming years for geese nesting at low density. Goose nesting success declined as distance from owls increased and reached a plateau at 550 m. Artificial nest experiments indicated that owls can exclude predators from the vicinity of their nests and thus reduce goose egg predation rate. Annual nest failure rate was negatively associated with rodent abundance and was generally highest in low lemming years. This relationship was present even after excluding goose nests under the protective influence of owls. However, nest failure was inversely density-dependent at high breeding density. Thus, annual variations in nest density influenced the synchrony between lemming cycles and oscillations in nesting success. Our results suggest that APH is the main mechanism linking lemming cycles and goose nesting success and that nesting associations during peak lemming years (NAH) can enhance this positive link at the local level. The study also shows that breeding strategies used by birds (the alternative prey) could affect the synchrony between oscillations in avian reproductive success and rodent cycles.},

  abstract = {Recent changes in climate have led to significant shifts in phenology, with many studies demonstrating advanced phenology in response to warming temperatures. The rate of temperature change is especially high in the Arctic, but this is also where we have relatively little data on phenological changes and the processes driving these changes. In order to understand how Arctic plant species are likely to respond to future changes in climate, we monitored flowering phenology in response to both experimental and ambient warming for four widespread species in two habitat types over 21 years. We additionally used long-term environmental records to disentangle the effects of temperature increase and changes in snowmelt date on phenological patterns. While flowering occurred earlier in response to experimental warming, plants in unmanipulated plots showed no change or a delay in flowering over the 21-year period, despite more than 1 \textdegree C of ambient warming during that time. This counterintuitive result was likely due to significantly delayed snowmelt over the study period (0.05\textendash 0.2 days/yr) due to increased winter snowfall. The timing of snowmelt was a strong driver of flowering phenology for all species \textendash{} especially for early-flowering species \textendash{} while spring temperature was significantly related to flowering time only for later-flowering species. Despite significantly delayed flowering phenology, the timing of seed maturation showed no significant change over time, suggesting that warmer temperatures may promote more rapid seed development. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the specific environmental cues that drive species' phenological responses as well as the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation when forecasting phenology over the coming decades. As demonstrated here, the effects of altered snowmelt patterns can counter the effects of warmer temperatures, even to the point of generating phenological responses opposite to those predicted by warming alone.},

Plot-based vegetation surveys provide detailed insight into vegetation changes at sites around the Arctic and improve our ability to predict the impacts of environmental change on tundra ecosystems. Here, we review studies of changes in plant community composition and phenology from both long-term monitoring and warming experiments in Arctic environments. We find that Arctic plant communities and species are generally sensitive to warming, but trends over a period of time are heterogeneous and complex and do not always mirror expectations based on responses to experimental manipulations. Our findings highlight the need for more geographically widespread, integrated, and comprehensive monitoring efforts that can better resolve the interacting effects of warming and other local and regional ecological factors.},

  abstract = {Landscapes of Fear (LOF), the spatially explicit distribution of perceived predation risk as seen by a population, is increasingly cited in ecological literature and has become a frequently used "buzz-word". With the increase in popularity, it became necessary to clarify the definition for the term, suggest boundaries and propose a common framework for its use. The LOF, as a progeny of the "ecology of fear" conceptual framework, defines fear as the strategic manifestation of the cost-benefit analysis of food and safety tradeoffs. In addition to direct predation risk, the LOF is affected by individuals' energetic-state, inter- and intra-specific competition and is constrained by the evolutionary history of each species. Herein, based on current applications of the LOF conceptual framework, I suggest the future research in this framework will be directed towards: (1) finding applied management uses as a trait defining a population's habitat-use and habitat-suitability; (2) studying multi-dimensional distribution of risk-assessment through time and space; (3) studying variability between individuals within a population; (4) measuring eco-neurological implications of risk as a feature of environmental heterogeneity and (5) expanding temporal and spatial scales of empirical studies.},

  abstract = {The period of growth prior to fledging is a critical life stage for most birds, and shifts in diet during ontogeny may affect growth and development. We used nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N) stable isotopes in feather tissue to quantify dietary composition and evaluate the relationship between diet and growth in prefledging Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Sequential sampling of {$\delta$}15N from feather tissue that was synthesized throughout growth allowed us to evaluate changes in plant versus invertebrate contributions to chick diet during the first 28 days posthatch. Feathers became depleted in {$\delta$}15N throughout growth, and Bayesian mixing models suggested that the proportional contribution of invertebrate nitrogen declined with chick age. We estimate that invertebrate contributions to the protein in chick diets decreased from 39\% at 1 week to 23\% at 4 weeks of age, which is consistent with previous research on sage-grouse that used traditional diet-sampling methods. Chicks with feather {$\delta$}15N values that spanned a larger range, but had an intermediate mean, had the longest tarsi and greatest mass at 28 days. These chicks also displayed a more rapid transition to herbivory during the prefledgling period. These patterns are consistent with greater importance of invertebrates during early growth but also suggest that a rapid transition to a more herbivorous diet ultimately results in the highest growth rates. Sequential sampling of feather {$\delta$}15N provided useful information on temporal patterns in chick diet that were directly relatable to growth during the prefledging stage, and we encourage replication of our approach in other systems.

The treatments also produced differences in the adult size of experimental birds, differences not evident in either their parents or their own offspring. Diet quality had the strongest impact on adult mass and tarsus length, while plumage and beak measurements were less affected. Analysis using principal components and character ratios showed that the shape of experimental birds was affected by the experimental diets, but to a minor extent compared with changes in overall size. Significant shape changes involved ratios between fast- and slow-growing characters. The ratios of characters that grow at similar, slow rates (e.g. beak shape) were not affected by the diets.

  abstract = {Climate warming is affecting the Arctic in multiple ways, including via increased dominance of deciduous shrubs. Although many studies have focused on how this vegetation shift is altering nutrient cycling and energy balance, few have explicitly considered effects on tundra fauna, such as the millions of migratory songbirds that breed in northern regions every year. To understand how increasing deciduous shrub dominance may alter breeding songbird habitat, we quantified vegetation and arthropod community characteristics in both graminoid and shrub dominated tundra. We combined measurements of preferred nest site characteristics for Lapland longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus) and Gambel's White-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) with modeled predictions for the distribution of plant community types in the Alaskan arctic foothills region for the year 2050. Lapland longspur nests were found in sedge-dominated tussock tundra where shrub height does not exceed 20 cm, whereas White-crowned sparrows nested only under shrubs between 20 cm and 1 m in height, with no preference for shrub species. Shrub canopies had higher canopy-dwelling arthropod availability (i.e. small flies and spiders) but lower ground-dwelling arthropod availability (i.e. large spiders and beetles). Since flies are the birds' preferred prey, increasing shrubs may result in a net enhancement in preferred prey availability. Acknowledging the coarse resolution of existing tundra vegetation models, we predict that by 2050 there will be a northward shift in current White-crowned sparrow habitat range and a 20\textendash 60\% increase in their preferred habitat extent, while Lapland longspur habitat extent will be equivalently reduced. Our findings can be used to make first approximations of future habitat change for species with similar nesting requirements. However, we contend that as exemplified by this study's findings, existing tundra modeling tools cannot yet simulate the fine-scale habitat characteristics that are critical to accurately predicting future habitat extent for many wildlife species.},

Several explanations have been suggested: deforestation on the wintering grounds in the tropics and habitat loss, increased predation pressure, and increased cowbirds parasitism on the breeding range. We used these factors to assign 47 species of insectivorous passerines to groups with contrasting vulnerability, and then used the North America Breeding Bird Survey to analyze population trends in these groups on a large continental scale. Variables indexing susceptibility to predation on the breeding ground were most strongly correlated with population trends form 1968 to 1987. During the period from 1978 to 1987, migratory status was also significantly associated with population trends long-distance migrants to the neotropics exhibited a small, nonsignificant decreasing trend, whereas residents and short-distance migrants increased strongly. During the same time period, the group of species with low nest location, open nest, and high cowbird parasitism declined significantly. Although it is difficult to separate the effects of multiple factors, our analyses suggest that predation on the breeding ground in North America has played a larger role in the decline of migratory songbirds than deforestation on the wintering grounds in the tropics.},

B2 species may be fast growing because sibling competition exerts a strong selective force for rapid growth. Other hypotheses have been proposed to explain the slow growth of Bl's. To overcome the problem inherent in previous investigations of comparing species widely divergent in ecology and phylogeny, I analyzed patterns of variation in growth of one group only: eagles of the world. I fitted growth curves to data obtained from the literature for some species, but most eagles were compared using the length of the nestling period as an indicator of growth rate. I also collected data on the growth of wild Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nestlings. I investigated how postnatal growth may be related to brood size, clutch size, nestling mortality, body size, and prenatal growth. Bl eagles were found to grow slower than B2 eagles. Differences in foraging ecology, diet, and mode of development are unlikely to account for the observed variability in the rate and form of growth. Contrary to the sibling competition hypothesis, growth rate was not correlated with the intensity of sibling competition. Eagles that regularly lay two eggs but always lose one chick because of sibling competition (obligate fratricide) grow slower than those species in which such mortality may or may not occur (facultative fratricide). Species characterized by facultative fratricide grow at a rate expected for their adult body size, whereas B1 species do not. B1 eagles are characterized by growth curves with early inflection points compared to B2 eagles. The shape of the growth curves and slower growth rates of Bl species are contrary to predictions of the sibling competition hypothesis, and may instead have resulted from selection to reduce peak energy requirements of the nestlings. I present a model of the effect of hatching interval, species-specific growth rate, and relative growth of siblings, on the probability of fratricide, which suggests that sibling competition is not an important factor in selecting for rapid growth.},

However, compelling evidence that these traits actually predict long-term survival and reproductive success among individuals in the wild is lacking. Here, we show that body condition (i.e., size-adjusted body mass) and cutaneous immune responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) injection among neonates positively predict recruitment and subsequent longevity in a wild, migratory population of House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon). However, neonates with intermediate hematocrit had the highest recruitment and longevity. Neonates with the highest PHA responsiveness and intermediate hematocrit prior to independence eventually produced the most offspring during their lifetime breeding on the study site. Importantly, the effects of PHA responsiveness and hematocrit were revealed while controlling for variation in body condition, sex, and environmental variation. Thus, our data demonstrate that body condition, cutaneous immune responsiveness, and hematocrit as a neonate are associated with individual fitness. Although hematocrit's effect is more complex than traditionally thought, our results suggest a previously underappreciated role for this trait in influencing survival in the wild.},

  abstract = {Ecoacoustics, the study of environmental sound, is a growing field with great potential for biodiversity monitoring. Audio recordings could provide a rapid, cost-effective monitoring tool offering novel insights into ecosystem dynamics. More than 60 acoustic indices have been developed to date, which reflect distinct attributes of the soundscape, (i.e. the total acoustic energy at a given location, including noise produced by animals, machinery, wind and rain). However, reported patterns in acoustic indices have been contradictory, possibly because there is no accepted best practice for the collection and analysis of audio recordings. Here, we propose: (a) guidelines for designing studies using audio recordings for the rapid assessment of multiple sites; and (b) a workflow for comparing recordings with seven of the most commonly used indices, permitting discrimination among habitat-specific soundscapes. We collected and analysed over 26,000 hr of recordings from 117 sites across a range of habitats in a human-modified tropical landscape in central Panama; an order of magnitude more recordings than used in previously published studies. We demonstrate that: (a) Standard error variance of indices stabilizes within 120 hr of recordings from a single location. (b) Continuous recording should be used rather than subsample recording on a schedule; sub sampling is a common practice but delays capture of site variability and maximizing total duration of recording should be prioritized. (c) Use of multiple indices to describe soundscape patterns reveals distinct diel and seasonal soundscape patterns among habitats. We advocate collecting at least 120 hr of continuous recordings per site, and using a range of acoustic indices to categorize the soundscape, including the Acoustic Complexity Index, Acoustic Evenness Index, Acoustic Entropy Index and the Normalized Difference Soundscape Index. Differences among habitat types can be captured if multiple indices are used, and magnitude of variance is often more important than mean values. The workflow we provide will enable successful use of ecoacoustic techniques for environmental monitoring.},

For two breeding seasons, individual pairs were offered supplemental food the first ten days after their young hatched. Under natural conditions this period was largely responsible for the seasonal variation in brood survival. Our experiment tested three hypotheses : (1) food supply is not involved in breeding success at any date (other factors h pothesis), (2) food supply limits success independently of date (ele ation h pothesis), and (3) food supply affects success seasonally and is responsible for the natural seasonal trend in success (date h pothesis). Experimental pairs with supplemental food raised heavier, larger and more chicks than control pairs. Consistent with the date h pothesis, food supplementation abolished seasonal variation in chick survival. Chick growth under supplemental food was in agreement with the ele ationhypothesis. This discrepancy was probably due to the limited supply of additional food. We conclude that seasonal variation in offspring production was in essence the result of seasonal variation in food availability.},

This self-contained book covers topics from the previous publications, while also including recent developments in method, software and application.Distance sampling refers to a suite of methods, including line and point transect sampling, in which animal density or abundance is estimated from a sample of distances to detected individuals. The book illustrates these methods through case studies; data sets and computer code are supplied to readers through the book's accompanying website. Some of the case studies use the software Distance, while others use R code. The book is in three parts. The first part addresses basic methods, the design of surveys, distance sampling experiments, field methods and data issues. The second part develops a range of modelling approaches for distance sampling data. The third part describes variations in the basic method; discusses special issues that arise when sampling different taxa (songbirds, seabirds, cetaceans, primates, ungulates, butterflies, and plants); considers advances to deal with failures of the key assumptions; and provides a check-list for those conducting surveys.},

Information-theoretic approaches emphasise a deliberate focus on the a priori science in developing a set of multiple working hypotheses or models. Simple methods then allow these hypotheses (models) to be ranked from best to worst and scaled to reflect a strength of evidence using the likelihood of each model (gi), given the data and the models in the set (i.e. L(gi | data)). In addition, a variance component due to model-selection uncertainty is included in estimates of precision. There are many cases where formal inference can be based on all the models in the a priori set and this multi-model inference represents a powerful, new approach to valid inference. Finally, we strongly recommend inferences based on a priori considerations be carefully separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging. An example is given for questions related to age- and sex-dependent rates of tag loss in elephant seals (Mirounga leonina).},

  abstract = {Monitoring patterns in biodiversity and phenology have become increasingly important given accelerating levels of anthropogenic change. Long-term monitoring programs have reported earlier occurrence of spring activity, reflecting species response to climate change. Although tracking shifts in spring migration represents a valuable approach to monitoring community-level consequences of climate change, robust long-term observations are challenging and costly. Audio recordings and metrics of bioacoustic activity could provide an effective method for monitoring changes in songbird activity and broader biotic interactions. We used 3 years of spring and fall recordings at six sites in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, an area experiencing rapid warming and glacial retreat, to examine the utility of bioacoustics to detect changes in songbird phenology. We calculated the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), an algorithm representing an index of bird community complexity. Abrupt changes in ACI values from winter to spring corresponded to spring transition, suggesting that ACI may be an effective, albeit coarse metric to detect the arrival of migrating songbirds. The first peak in ACI shifted from April 16 to April 11 from 2012 to 2014. Changes in ACI were less abrupt in the fall due to weather events, suggesting spring recordings are better suited to indicate phenology. To ensure changes in ACI values were detecting real changes in songbird activity, we explored the relationship between ACI and song of three species: varied thrush (Ixoreus naevius), Pacific wren (Troglodytes pacificus), and ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula). ACI was positively related to counts of all species, but most markedly with song of the varied thrush, the most common species in our recordings and a known indicator of forest ecosystem health. We conclude that acoustic recordings paired with bioacoustic indices may be a useful method of monitoring shifts in songbird communities due to climate change and other sources of anthropogenic disturbance.},

  abstract = {Food supplementation experiments have been widely used to get detailed insight into how food supply contributes to the reproductive performance of wild animals. Surprisingly, even though food seldom is distributed evenly in space, variation in local habitat quality has usually not been controlled for in food supplementation studies. With results from a two-year feeding experiment involving a habitat-sensitive avian top predator, the Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis, we show that treatment effects on goshawk reproductive performance are habitat dependent. Extra food reduced nestling mortality in low-quality territories where prime habitat (forest) is scarce, but not in high-quality territories where prime habitat is abundant. Consequently, brood size did not differ between treatment categories in heavily forested territories, but fledgling numbers differed between unfed and fed goshawk pairs breeding in territories where forest is scarce. However, because extra food was not superabundant, this artificial increase in offspring number induced a dramatic decrease in nestling condition in low-quality territories. Treatment effects were detected even after controlling statistically for other potentially confounding effects (year, territory identity) and strongly covaried with territory-specific abundances of the most important summer prey species. These results highlight the importance of acknowledging the effect that small-scale variation in habitat quality and availability of natural food may have on the results of food supplementation experiments. In order to assess the generality of food supplementation effects, the integration of habitat heterogeneity and variation in food abundance is thus needed, especially among species in which small-scale variation in habitat quality influences demographic patterns.},

Habitat use by geese and the availability and quality of aboveground biomass in wet sedge meadows and around ponds in lichen-heath tundra were also evaluated throughout the summer. During the first four weeks of brood-rearing, adult Canada Geese ate primarily graminoids (\&gt;65\%), especially leaves of the short form of Carex aquatilis and Eriophorum spp., which had the highest nitrogen concentration (2.5\textendash 3.5\%). Although graminoids were also important for goslings, they consumed a greater variety of other plant species (68\%) than adults, especially in the first two weeks, possibly because of their inexperience. Late in the brood-rearing period, as the nitrogen concentration of graminoid plants declined, adults shifted to a diet composed mainly of berries (\&gt;40\%, mostly Empetrum nigrum). At that time, goslings consumed fewer berries (24\%) and maintained a higher proportion of nitrogen-rich plants in their diet (53\% leaves, mostly graminoids) than adults, presumably to complete their growth. Plant species consumed by geese over the summer indicated a preference for high-quality plants (i.e. those with a high nitrogen concentration). Consequently, wet sedge meadow, the habitat that offered plant species of highest quality, was the habitat most heavily used throughout the summer, particularly around peak hatch. Goose grazing had no effect on seasonal production of aboveground biomass of graminoids, probably because of the relatively low density of the goose population.\'Ecologie alimentaire de Branta canadensis interior pendant la p\'eriode d'\'elevage des jeunes dans un milieu d'eau douce sub-arctique},

  abstract = {Many time-series smoothing methods can be used for reducing noise and extracting plant phenological parameters from remotely-sensed data, but there is still no conclusive evidence in favor of one method over others. Here we use moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate five smoothing methods: Savitzky-Golay fitting (SG), locally weighted regression scatterplot smoothing (LO), spline smoothing (SP), asymmetric Gaussian function fitting (AG), and double logistic function fitting (DL). We use ground tower measured NDVI (10 sites) and gross primary productivity (GPP, 4 sites) to evaluate the smoothed satellite-derived NDVI time-series, and elevation data to evaluate phenology parameters derived from smoothed NDVI. The results indicate that all smoothing methods can reduce noise and improve signal quality, but that no single method always performs better than others. Overall, the local filtering methods (SG and LO) can generate very accurate results if smoothing parameters are optimally calibrated. If local calibration cannot be performed, cross validation is a way to automatically determine the smoothing parameter. However, this method may in some cases generate poor fits, and when calibration is not possible the function fitting methods (AG and DL) provide the most robust description of the seasonal dynamics.},

Active throughout the year, voles and lemmings (arvicoline rodents) are central prey in arctic food webs. Snow cover, however, makes the estimation of their winter diet challenging. We analyzed the isotopic composition of ever-growing incisors from species of voles and lemmings in northern Finland trapped in the spring and autumn. We found that resources appear to be reasonably partitioned and largely congruent with phylogeny. Our results reveal that winter resource use can be inferred from the tooth isotopic composition of rodents sampled in the spring, when trapping can be conducted, and that resources appear to be partitioned via competition under the snow.},

Reproductive performance was recorded during five years, and food availability (arthropods, lizards, mice and birds) was monitored monthly during a wet and a dry breeding season. We found that increased rainfall in the previous autumn was associated with an earlier laying date and a more prolonged breeding season. Mean clutch size showed a positive correlation with rainfall in the month prior to laying. Hatching and fledgling success did not vary significantly between a wet and a dry year. Temperature did not influence breeding parameters. Despite the advanced laying date and larger clutch size observed, high prey availability during egg formation in the wet year did not result in higher overall breeding success. Stable between-year number of fledglings coincided with stable prey availability during the nestling or fledgling periods. Food conditions in the dry year were more stable and attuned to harsh weather conditions regardless of rainfall during the previous autumn and pre-breeding period.},

Some of these manipulations altered nutrient availability, growth\textemdash form composition, net primary production, and species richness in less than a decade, indicating that arctic vegetation at this site is sensitive to climatic change. In general, short\textemdash term (3\textemdash yr) responses were poor predictors of longer term (9\textemdash yr) changes in community composition. The longer term responses showed closer correspondence to patterns of vegetation distribution along environmental gradients. Nitrogen and phosphorus availability tended to increase in response to elevated temperature, reflecting increased mineralization, and in response to light attenuation, reflecting reduced nutrient uptake by vegetation. Nutrient addition increased biomass and production of deciduous shrubs but reduced growth of evergreen shrubs and nonvascular plants. Light attenuation reduced biomass of all growth forms. Elevated temperature enhanced shrub production but reduced production of nonvascular plants. These contrasting responses to temperature increase and to nutrient addition by different growth forms 'canceled out' at the ecosystem level, buffering changes in ecosystem characteristics such as biomass, production, and nutrient uptake. The major effect of elevated temperature was to speed plant response to changes in soil resources and, in the long term (9 yr), to increase nutrient availability through changes in N mineralization. Species within a growth form were similar to one another in their responses to changes in resources (light or nutrients) but showed no consistent response to evelated temperature. Species richness was reduced 30\textemdash 50\% by temperature and nutrient treatments, due to loss of less abundant species. Declines in diversity occurred disproportionately in forbs, which are important for animal nutrition, and in mosses, which maintain soil thermal regime. There was no increased abundance of initially rare species in response to any treatment. During our 9\textemdash yr study (the warmest decade on record in the region), biomass of one dominant tundra species unexpectedly changed in control plots in the direction predicted by our experiments and by Holocene pollen records. This suggests that regional climatic warming may already be altering the species composition of Alaskan arctic tundra.},

  abstract = {In many bird species, females undergo a marked decline in body condition during the first days of the nestling period. This decline may be because brooding young chicks reduces the time available for foraging. Alternatively, it might be viewed as an adaptive way to reduce flight costs when the food demand of the brood is highest. To test these hypotheses we modified the brooding commitment of House Sparrows Passer domesticus by manipulating brood size to see if changes in time spent brooding affects adult body condition. During the nestling period, females provided on average three times as much brooding as males. Reduced broods received 14\% more brooding than large broods and time spent brooding declined with brood size and chick age according to an exponential decay function. Male body condition was unaffected by brood size and remained stable throughout the reproductive period. Body condition of females with enlarged broods decreased gradually during the nestling period, whereas that of females tending reduced broods dropped abruptly and significantly upon hatching. This resulted in females with reduced broods having lower body condition during the first half of the nestling period than those with enlarged broods. The sharp drop in body condition of females with reduced broods coincided with the period that brooding was most intensive. Indeed, female body condition at the end of the nestling period was negatively correlated with the proportion of time they spent brooding during the first half of the nestling period. Thus, the probable lower homeothermic capacities of reduced broods implies a higher brooding commitment for female House Sparrows that, in turn, may reduce their opportunity to forage and consequently also their body condition.},

  abstract = {Long-term satellite remote sensing data, when properly calibrated and validated against ground monitoring, could provide valuable data sets for assessing climate change impacts on ecosystems, wildlife, and other important aspects of life in the Arctic. Percent plant cover is ideal for seasonal and long-term ground monitoring because it can be observed non-destructively and is closely related to other key ecosystem variables, such as biomass and leaf area index (LAI). Accurately measuring percent plant cover in the Arctic, however, has been a challenge. Advances in digital photography and imageprocessing techniques have provided the potential to measure vegetation cover accurately. In this paper we report an adapted method for quantifying percent plant cover based on plot digital photograph classification (PDPC). In this digital image analysis, the red, green, and blue image channels and the intensity, hue, and saturation image channels were used together to ensure more accurate cover measurement and labeling of plant species. We evaluated the accuracy of the PDPC method and two other techniques, visual estimate and digital grid overlay, by testing against artificial plots with known percent cover, by comparing with destructively measured LAI, and by comparing results of the three methods. Our evaluation indicates that the PDPC method is the most accurate. In addition, PDPC has the advantages of being objective, quick in the field, and suitable for measuring percent plant cover in the Arctic at the level of functional types or species groups.},

This study is aimed to assess the impacts of summer range forage availability and quality on Bathurst caribou's productivity and abundance. Despite well documented effects of habitat nutrition on individual animal, few studies have been able to link nutrition and population demographics in a quantitative fashion, probably because caribou productivity and abundance could be potentially affected by many factors (e.g., habitat, harvest, predators, diseases/parasites, extreme weather, climate change, industrial development, and pollution), and yet long-term data for many of these factors are not available. By determining the upper envelope curve between summer range indicators and caribou productivity, this study made such assessment possible. Our results indicate that summer range indicators derived from long-term remote sensing time series and climate records can explain 59\% of the variation in late-winter calf:cow ratio during 1985 and 2012. As a measure of caribounet productvitiy, the late-winter calf:cow ratio, together with the mortality rate, in turn determined population dynamics.},

Earth Observation (EO) has a key role to play in mapping habitat and biodiversity in general, providing tools for the systematic collection of environmental data. The recent GEO-BON European Biodiversity Observation Network project (EBONE) established a framework for an integrated biodiversity monitoring system. Underlying this framework is the idea of integrating in situ with EO and a habitat classification scheme based on General Habitat Categories (GHC), designed with an Earth Observation-perspective. Here we report on EBONE work that explored the use of NDVI-derived phenology metrics for the identification and mapping of Forest GHCs. Thirty-one phenology metrics were extracted from MODIS NDVI time series for Europe. Classifications to discriminate forest types were performed based on a Random Forests\texttrademark{} classifier in selected regions. Results indicate that date phenology metrics are generally more significant for forest type discrimination. The achieved class accuracies are generally not satisfactory, except for coniferous forests in homogeneous stands (77\textendash 82\%). The main causes of low classification accuracies were identified as (i) the spatial resolution of the imagery (250 m) which led to mixed phenology signals; (ii) the GHC scheme classification design, which allows for parcels of heterogeneous covers, and (iii) the low number of the training samples available from field surveys. A mapping strategy integrating EO-based phenology with vegetation height information is expected to be more effective than a purely phenology-based approach.},

Few studies, however, have assessed the effectiveness of these mitigation measures in a multispecies or community level context. We used a null model to test whether wildlife crossing structures serve large mammal species equally or whether such structures limit habitat connectivity across roads in species-specific ways. We also modeled species responses to 14 variables related to underpass structure, landscape features, and human activity. Species performance ratios (observed crossing frequency to expected crossing frequency) were evaluated for four large carnivore and three ungulate species in 11 underpass structures in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. Observed crossing frequencies were collected in 35 months of underpass monitoring. Expected frequencies were developed from three independent models: radio telemetry, pellet counts, and habitat-suitability indices. The null model showed that species responded to underpasses differently. In the presence of human activity carnivores were less likely to use underpasses than were ungulates. Apart from human activity, carnivore performance ratios were better correlated to landscape variables, and ungulate performance ratios were better correlated to structural variables. We suggest that future underpasses designed around topography, habitat quality, and location will be minimally successful if human activity is not managed.},

In particular, the sea ice extent has been declining at the rate of {$\sim$}3.8\%/decade, whereas the perennial ice (represented by summer ice minimum) is declining at a much greater rate of {$\sim$}11.5\%/decade. Spring snow cover has also been observed to be declining by -2.12\%/decade for the period 1967\textendash 2012.

  abstract = {Nest success is a critical determinant of the dynamics of avian populations, and nest survival modeling has played a key role in advancing avian ecology and management. Beginning with the development of daily nest survival models, and proceeding through subsequent extensions, the capacity for modeling the effects of hypothesized factors on nest survival has expanded greatly. We extend nest survival models further by introducing an approach to deal with incompletely observed, temporally varying covariates using a hierarchical model. Hierarchical modeling offers a way to separate process and observational components of demographic models to obtain estimates of the parameters of primary interest, and to evaluate structural effects of ecological and management interest. We built a hierarchical model for daily nest survival to analyze nest data from reintroduced whooping cranes (Grus americana) in the Eastern Migratory Population. This reintroduction effort has been beset by poor reproduction, apparently due primarily to nest abandonment by breeding birds. We used the model to assess support for the hypothesis that nest abandonment is caused by harassment from biting insects. We obtained indices of blood-feeding insect populations based on the spatially interpolated counts of insects captured in carbon dioxide traps. However, insect trapping was not conducted daily, and so we had incomplete information on a temporally variable covariate of interest. We therefore supplemented our nest survival model with a parallel model for estimating the values of the missing insect covariates. We used Bayesian model selection to identify the best predictors of daily nest survival. Our results suggest that the black fly Simulium annulus may be negatively affecting nest survival of reintroduced whooping cranes, with decreasing nest survival as abundance of S. annulus increases. The modeling framework we have developed will be applied in the future to a larger data set to evaluate the biting-insect hypothesis and other hypotheses for nesting failure in this reintroduced population; resulting inferences will support ongoing efforts to manage this population via an adaptive management approach. Wider application of our approach offers promise for modeling the effects of other temporally varying, but imperfectly observed covariates on nest survival, including the possibility of modeling temporally varying covariates collected from incubating adults.},

We video-monitored nests and identified predators at 120 nests of the Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) and the Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) at eight study sites in Missouri and Illinois, USA, during 2007\textendash 2010. We used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate hypotheses concerning factors affecting predator-specific and overall rates of predation at landscape, edge, and nest-site scales. We found support for effects of landscape forest cover and distance to habitat edge. Predation by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased, and predation by rodents decreased as landscape forest cover decreased. Predation by raptors, rodents, and snakes increased as the distance to forest edges decreased, but the effect was modest and conditional upon the top-ranked model. Despite the predator-specific patterns we detected, there was no support for these effects on overall rates of predation. The interactions between breeding birds, nest predators, and the landscapes in which they reside are scale-dependent and context-specific, and may be resistant to broad conceptual management recommendations.},

  abstract = {Many animal monitoring studies seek to estimate the proportion of a study area occupied by a target population. The study area is divided into spatially distinct sites where the detected presence or absence of the population is recorded, and this is repeated in time for multiple seasons. However, when occupied sites are detected with probability p {$<$} 1, the lack of a detection does not imply lack of occupancy. MacKenzie et al. (2003, Ecology 84, 2200\textendash 2207) developed a multiseason model for estimating seasonal site occupancy ({$\psi$}t ) while accounting for unknown p. Their model performs well when observations are collected according to the robust design, where multiple sampling occasions occur during each season; the repeated sampling aids in the estimation p. However, their model does not perform as well when the robust design is lacking. In this paper, we propose an alternative likelihood model that yields improved seasonal estimates of p and {$\Psi$}t in the absence of the robust design. We construct the marginal likelihood of the observed data by conditioning on, and summing out, the latent number of occupied sites during each season. A simulation study shows that in cases without the robust design, the proposed model estimates p with less bias than the MacKenzie et al. model and hence improves the estimates of {$\Psi$}t . We apply both models to a data set consisting of repeated presence\textendash absence observations of American robins (Turdus migratorius) with yearly survey periods. The two models are compared to a third estimator available when the repeated counts (from the same study) are considered, with the proposed model yielding estimates of {$\Psi$}t closest to estimates from the point count model.},

Such intraspecific differences in behaviour have been widely assumed to be non-adaptive variation surrounding (possibly) adaptive population-average behaviour. Nevertheless, in keeping with recent calls to apply Darwinian reasoning to ever-finer scales of biological variation, we sketch the fundamentals of an adaptive theory of consistent individual differences in behaviour. Our thesis is based on the notion that such `personality differences' can be selected for if fitness payoffs are dependent on both the frequencies with which competing strategies are played and an individual's behavioural history. To this end, we review existing models that illustrate this and propose a game theoretic approach to analyzing personality differences that is both dynamic and state-dependent. Our motivation is to provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of an apparently common animal trait: personality, which has far reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.},

Available methods for estimating nest loss probabilities to competing sources do not allow for random effects and covariation among sources, and there are few data simulation methods or goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests for such models. We developed a Bayesian multinomial extension of the widely used logistic exposure (LE) nest survival model which can incorporate multiple random effects and fixed-effect covariates for each nest loss category. We investigated the performance of this model and the accompanying GOF test by analysing simulated nest fate datasets with and without age-biased discovery probability, and by comparing the estimates with those of traditional fixed-effects estimators. We then exemplify the use of the multinomial LE model and GOF test by analysing Piping Plover Charadrius melodus nest fate data (n = 443) to explore the effects of wire cages (exclosures) constructed around nests, which are used to protect nests from predation but can lead to increased nest abandonment rates. Mean parameter estimates of the randomeffects multinomial LE model were all within 1 sd of the true values used to simulate the datasets. Age-biased discovery probability did not result in biased parameter estimates. Traditional fixed-effects models provided estimates with a high bias of up to 43\% with a mean of 71\% smaller standard deviations. The GOF test identified models that were a poor fit to the simulated data. For the Piping Plover dataset, the fixed-effects model was less well-supported than the random-effects model and underestimated the risk of exclosure use by 16\%. The random-effects model estimated a range of 1\textendash 6\% probability of abandonment for nests not protected by exclosures across sites and 5\textendash 41\% probability of abandonment for nests with exclosures, suggesting that the magnitude of exclosure-related abandonment is site-specific. Our results demonstrate that unmodelled heterogeneity can result in biased estimates potentially leading to incorrect management recommendations. The Bayesian multinomial LE model offers a flexible method of incorporating random effects into an analysis of nest failure and is robust to age-biased nest discovery probability. This model can be generalized to other staggered-entry, time-to-hazard situations.},

  abstract = {We investigated how natural variation in abundance and availability of the main prey of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius), small mammals, influenced provisioning rates by parents, and offspring size and survival. Provisioning behavior of kestrels was not constrained by the abundance of food in the environment; however, the availability of food, mediated through variation in weather, appeared to significantly influence parental provisioning behavior. Moreover, variation in weather had clear effects on reproductive success because nestlings exposed to inclement weather were smaller and lighter at fledging, and less likely to survive to fledging, compared to nestlings raised during good weather conditions. Prey abundance was not related to offspring size or survival. Our results suggest American Kestrels are limited by the availability, as opposed to abundance, of food on territories. It is likely that during our study, prey abundance was above some minimum threshold necessary to support successful reproduction, and so variation in weather affected reproduction more than variation in prey abundance.},

  abstract = {[For birds with altricial young, the brood-rearing period is one of the most energetically expensive periods in their lives and may be the bottleneck for fitness. Because parents are expected to be prudent in allocating resources between reproduction and self-maintenance, food supply should be an important factor determining reproductive decisions during brood rearing. Parents with abundant food are expected to have enhanced fitness because they are able to reduce their work rates and increase their own survival chances, because their offspring may be of higher quality, or some combination of these. However, few studies have simultaneously documented all of these variables in a single investigation. We performed a food supplementation experiment to test how food supply influenced provisioning decisions by parent American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Female kestrels showed a strong response to extra food and reduced their provisioning rates. As a result, supplemented females had higher return rates than control females, suggesting significant effects of food on female survival. Because females used extra food to increase their fitness, our results suggest that kestrels raising offspring are limited by food. Male kestrels whose nests were supplemented also responded to extra food by reducing provisioning, but to a much lesser extent than their mates. Male parents did not appear to benefit from supplementation, as their return rates were similar to control males. The total amount of food received on a daily basis by nestlings was similar between supplemented and control nests. Supplemented offspring therefore did not fledge in better condition or have higher survival rates than control nestlings; the only significant factor consistently affecting offspring condition and survival was weather.]},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic alteration of landscapes can affect avian nest success by influencing the abundance, distribution, and behavior of predators. Understanding avian nest predation risk necessitates understanding how landscapes affect predator distribution and behavior. From a sample of 463 nests of 17 songbird species, we evaluated how landscape features (distance to forest edge, unpaved roads, and power lines) influenced daily nest survival. We also used video cameras to identify nest predators at 137 nest predation events and evaluated how landscape features influenced predator identity. Finally, we determined the abundance and distribution of several of the principal predators using surveys and radiotelemetry. Distance to power lines was the best predictor of predator identity: predation by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), corvids (Corvus sp. and Cyanocitta cristata), racers (Coluber constrictor), and coachwhips (Masticophis flagellum) increased with proximity to power lines, whereas predation by rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta) and raptors decreased. In some cases, predator density may reliably indicate nest predation risk because racers, corvids, and cowbirds frequently used power line right-of-ways. Of five bird species with enough nests to analyze individually, daily nest survival of only indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) decreased with proximity to power lines, despite predation by most predators at our site being positively associated with power lines. For all nesting species combined, distance to unpaved road was the model that most influenced daily nest survival. This pattern is likely a consequence of rat snakes, the locally dominant nest predator (28\% of predation events), rarely using power lines and associated areas. Instead, rat snakes were frequently associated with road edges, indicating that not all edges are functionally similar. Our results suggest that interactions between predators and landscape features are likely to be specific to both the local predators and landscape. Thus, predicting how anthropogenic changes to landscapes affect nesting birds requires that we know more about how landscape changes affect the behavior of nest predators and which nest predators are locally important.},

The butterfly has been shown to emerge on average 9 (males) to 12 (females) days earlier per decade, 19 and 24 days earlier respectively over the study period. Emergence dates relate strongly to spring temperatures, particularly with daily maximum temperatures for the months March to May. Temperatures for these months have increased significantly during this period (0.7\textdegree C to 1.8\textdegree C per decade). Three factors suggest that the strongest influence of the rise in spring temperatures has been on late larval instar growth and development: (i) May temperatures dominate emergence date models and larvae are feeding faster and for longer periods during this month, (ii) Salix caprea flowering date, a surrogate for bud burst, is excluded in stepwise regression models with temperatures and years suggesting that tree phenology may be less important than temperature effects on later development, and (iii) convergence of female and male emergence dates over time points to limits on earlier feeding in protandrous males. A negative consequence observed with earlier emergence dates is lethal extra broods.},

  abstract = {Livestock production extends to most non-forested, marginal, upland habitats of Britain. Of these, indigenous grasslands are stocked predominantly by sheep, stocking densities having increased in Scotland by 25\% between 1975 and 1990. Conversely, the national herd of cattle in Scotland declined by 22\% over the same period. The effects of grazing management on arthropod distribution and abundance is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the results of grazing experiments that have investigated the effects on arthropods of varied livestock species and stocking rates. Arthropods contribute the most species of any taxa in the uplands and are critical in upland food chains. The direction and magnitude of the response of different arthropod taxa to grazing management reflects their trophic level, life history, size and mobility, e.g., 30 \% of ground and rove beetle species are more sensitive to landform than grazing management. For the arthropod taxa that are sensitive to grazing management, the effects are generally indirect, via changes in the heterogeneity of botanical composition and vegetation structure. A mosaic of contrasting botanical composition and structural heterogeneity is essential to conserve and enhance arthropod and broader wildlife diversity in the uplands. However, the landscape-scale study of mammalian herbivore-vegetation-arthropod interactions is required both to quantify the relative importance of land use (grazing management) and landform (landscape physiognomy) across the uplands and to determine the optimal grain-size of the habitat mosaic to sustain biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Climate warming is pronounced in the Arctic and migratory birds are expected to be among the most affected species. We examined the effects of local and regional climatic variations on the breeding phenology and reproductive success of greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica), a migratory species nesting in the Canadian Arctic. We used a long-term dataset based on the monitoring of 5447 nests and the measurements of 19 234 goslings over 16 years (1989\textendash 2004) on Bylot Island. About 50\% of variation in the reproductive phenology of individuals was explained by spring climatic factors. High mean temperatures and, to a lesser extent, low snow cover in spring were associated with an increase in nest density and early egg-laying and hatching dates. High temperature in spring and high early summer rainfall were positively related to nesting success. These effects may result from a reduction in egg predation rate when the density of nesting geese is high and when increased water availability allows females to stay close to their nest during incubation recesses. Summer brood loss and production of young at the end of the summer increased when values of the summer Arctic Oscillation (AO) index were either very positive (low temperatures) or very negative (high temperatures), indicating that these components of the breeding success were most influenced by the regional summer climate. Gosling mass and size near fledging were reduced in years with high spring temperatures. This effect is likely due to a reduced availability of high quality food in years with early spring, either due to food depletion resulting from high brood density or a mismatch between hatching date of goslings and the timing of the peak of plant quality. Our analysis suggests that climate warming should advance the reproductive phenology of geese, but that high spring temperatures and extreme values of the summer AO index may decrease their reproductive success up to fledging.},

  abstract = {Estimation of avian nest survival has traditionally involved simple measures of apparent nest survival or Mayfield constant-nest-survival models. However, these methods do not allow researchers to build models that rigorously assess the importance of a wide range of biological factors that affect nest survival. Models that incorporate greater detail, such as temporal variation in nest survival and covariates representative of individual nests represent a substantial improvement over traditional estimation methods. In an attempt to improve nest survival estimation procedures, we introduce the nest survival model now available in the program MARK and demonstrate its use on a nesting study of Mountain Plovers (Charadrius montanus Townsend) in Montana, USA. We modeled the daily survival of Mountain Plover nests as a function of the sex of the incubating adult, nest age, year, linear and quadratic time trends, and two weather covariates (maximum daily temperature and daily precipitation) during a six-year study (1995\textendash 2000). We found no evidence for yearly differences or an effect of maximum daily temperature on the daily nest survival of Mountain Plovers. Survival rates of nests tended by female and male plovers differed (female rate ϭ 0.33; male rate ϭ 0.49). The estimate of the additive effect for males on nest survival rate was 0.37 (95\% confidence limits were 0.03, 0.71) on a logit scale. Daily survival rates of nests increased with nest age; the estimate of daily nest-age change in survival in the best model was 0.06 (95\% confidence limits were 0.04, 0.09) on a logit scale. Daily precipitation decreased the probability that the nest would survive to the next day; the estimate of the additive effect of daily precipitation on the nest survival rate was Ϫ1.08 (95\% confidence limits were Ϫ2.12, Ϫ0.13) on a logit scale. Our approach to modeling daily nest-survival rates allowed several biological factors of interest to be easily included in nest survival models and allowed us to generate more biologically meaningful estimates of nest survival.},

  abstract = {Juvenile survival is often found to be more sensitive than adult survival to variation in environmental conditions, and variation in juvenile survival can have significant impacts on population growth rates and viability. Therefore, understanding the populationlevel effects of environmental changes requires understanding the effects on juvenile survival. We hypothesized that parental care will buffer the survival of dependent juveniles from variation in environmental conditions, while the survival of independent juveniles will respond more strongly to environmental variation and, in turn, drive the overall variation in annual juvenile survival. We tested this parental-care hypothesis using a 30-year mark\textendash recapture data set to model the survival of juvenile Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) during the dependent and independent stages. We examined the effects of weather, density, and cohort mean fledge date and body mass on annual variation in survival during the first 12 weeks after fledging, as well as effects of individual fledge date and body mass on individual variation in survival. The primary driver of annual variation in juvenile survival was precipitation during the previous rainy season, consistent with an effect on food availability, which had a strong positive effect on the survival of independent juveniles, but no effect on dependent juveniles. We also found strong support for effects of body mass and fledge date on individual survival probability, including striking differences in the effect of fledge date by stage. Our results provided evidence that different mechanisms influence juvenile survival during each stage of fledgling development, and that parental care buffers the survival of dependent juveniles from variation in environmental conditions. Consequently, variation in juvenile survival was driven by independent juveniles, not dependent juveniles, and studies focused only on survival during the dependent stage may not be able to detect the major drivers of variation in juvenile survival. We recommend that future efforts to understand or project the population-level effects of environmental change not only examine the effects on juvenile survival, but specifically consider the survival of independent juveniles, as well as how the drivers of variation in juvenile survival may vary by stage.},

We examined the effects of distance of the nest from foraging waters and of microclimate at the nest site on the loon's reproductive success. As distance from the ocean increased, both density and nesting success decreased. Although hatching success did not vary with distance, success in rearing both chicks was significantly lower at distances greater than 9 km from the ocean. Loons with nests further from the ocean fed chicks less often and spent more time on foraging flights than did loons nesting within 9 km of the ocean. Brood reduction in nests far from the ocean presumably resulted from nestling starvation, and possibly also from higher predation due to less effective nest defense. We suggest that the higher density of breeding loons in areas near the ocean reflects preference of these birds for nesting grounds that are closer to their foraging areas. Microclimatic conditions also influenced reproductive success. In areas available for nesting earlier in the year, the loons initiated nesting earlier, but the probability of their reproductive failure due to predation was higher. However, successful pairs in these areas raised larger broods (two chicks) more often than those in areas where birds started breeding later.},

  abstract = {Understanding the sensitivity of tundra vegetation to climate warming is critical to forecasting future biodiversity and vegetation feedbacks to climate. In situ warming experiments accelerate climate change on a small scale to forecast responses of local plant communities. Limitations of this approach include the apparent site-specificity of results and uncertainty about the power of short-term studies to anticipate longer term change. We address these issues with a synthesis of 61 experimental warming studies, of up to 20 years duration, in tundra sites worldwide. The response of plant groups to warming often differed with ambient summer temperature, soil moisture and experimental duration. Shrubs increased with warming only where ambient temperature was high, whereas graminoids increased primarily in the coldest study sites. Linear increases in effect size over time were frequently observed. There was little indication of saturating or accelerating effects, as would be predicted if negative or positive vegetation feedbacks were common. These results indicate that tundra vegetation exhibits strong regional variation in response to warming, and that in vulnerable regions, cumulative effects of long-term warming on tundra vegetation - and associated ecosystem consequences - have the potential to be much greater than we have observed to date.},

  abstract = {Inference about future climate change impacts typically relies on one of three approaches: manipulative experiments, historical comparisons (broadly defined to include monitoring the response to ambient climate fluctuations using repeat sampling of plots, dendroecology, and paleoecology techniques), and space-for-time substitutions derived from sampling along environmental gradients. Potential limitations of all three approaches are recognized. Here we address the congruence among these three main approaches by comparing the degree to which tundra plant community composition changes (i) in response to in situ experimental warming, (ii) with interannual variability in summer temperature within sites, and (iii) over spatial gradients in summer temperature. We analyzed changes in plant community composition from repeat sampling (85 plant communities in 28 regions) and experimental warming studies (28 experiments in 14 regions) throughout arctic and alpine North America and Europe. Increases in the relative abundance of species with a warmer thermal niche were observed in response to warmer summer temperatures using all three methods; however, effect sizes were greater over broad-scale spatial gradients relative to either temporal variability in summer temperature within a site or summer temperature increases induced by experimental warming. The effect sizes for change over time within a site and with experimental warming were nearly identical. These results support the view that inferences based on space-for-time substitution overestimate the magnitude of responses to contemporary climate warming, because spatial gradients reflect long-term processes. In contrast, in situ experimental warming and monitoring approaches yield consistent estimates of the magnitude of response of plant communities to climate warming.},

Here, using an extensive time series dataset of riverine fish communities across different biogeographic regions of the world, we assessed the effects of nonnative species on the temporal variability and synchrony in abundance at different organizational levels (population, metapopulation, community and metacommunity) and spatial scales (stream reach and river basin). At the reach scale, we found that populations of nonnative species were more variable over time than native species, and that this effect scaled up to the community level \textendash{} significantly destabilizing the dynamics of riverine fish communities. Nonnative species not only contributed to reduced community stability, but also increased variability of native populations. By contrast, we found no effect of nonnative species dominance on local interspecific synchrony among native species. At the basin scale, nonnative metapopulations were again more variable than the native ones. However, neither native metapopulations nor metacommunities showed differences in temporal variability or synchrony as nonnative species dominance increased basin-wide. This suggests a `dilution effect' where the contribution to regional stability of local native populations from sites displaying low levels of invasion reduced the destabilizing effects of nonnative species. Overall, our results indicate that accounting for the destabilizing effect of nonnative species is critical to understanding native species persistence and community stability.},

Nestling growth and daily survival rates of the Western Reef Heron Egretta gularis were studied in Hara Biosphere Reserve, Persian Gulf, Iran. Growth parameters were determined in relation to both age ranking of each nestling within a brood and the brood size using data from known-age nestlings. Nesting success was modeled based on the information-theoretic approach implemented by the program MARK to assess the effects of clutch initiation date, nest size and location on daily survival rates of nests. Mean daily growth rate of body mass was 18.06 \AE{} 6.22 g during the first 2 weeks of age and was independent of brood size but was greater in nestlings hatching earlier within the brood. Wing and tarsus growth rate was influenced by both brood size and nestling rank within the brood, but culmen growth was independent of both factors. Earlier hatched nestlings grew faster than those hatched later. Growth of all morphometric parameters followed the Logistic growth curve model except for wing chord, which fitted the Gompertz growth model. Nest size and nest height above the ground were the most important predictors of nest survival (xi = 0.79 and xi = 0.69, respectively), with survival among Western Reef Heron nests improving as the nest size and nest height increased. This study shows the importance of temporal and spatial variables for breeding ecology of a common but little-known breeding heron in coastal areas of Persian Gulf.},

  abstract = {It is assumed that widespread, generalist species have high phenotypic variation, but we know little about how intraspecific trait variation (ITV) relates to species abundance and niche breadth. In the temperate rainforest of southern Chile, we hypothesized that species with wide niche breadth would exhibit 1) high among-plot ITV, 2) a strong relationship between trait values and the environment, and 3) a close fit between traits and local environment trait optima. We measured leaf functional traits (leaf area, LMA, leaf N and P concentrations) of saplings in woody species, and compared the relative abundance of each species with its niche breadth, measured as the range of light, soil N and P availability. We used the slope of the linear regression of species' trait\textendash environment relationships to assess the strength and direction of these relationships, and measured the degree to which species' trait values track the environmental optimum across plots. In some cases, species having wide niche breadth had high ITV in leaf N and also matched traits (LMA and leaf P) to local optima along the light gradient; they also had high ITV in general and matched leaf P to local optima along the soil P gradient. The relationship between species with wide niche breadth and the strength of intraspecific trait\textendash environment relationships was generally weak and varied depending on the niche dimension and trait in question. Species varied considerably in the strength of trait\textendash environment relationships and total magnitude of ITV, and this variation was not generally strongly related to species abundances or niche breadth patterns. In conclusion, trait variation at the community level is not driven by a few abundant, widely distributed species, but depends on the aggregate trait responses of both abundant and rare species. This makes it difficult to scale individual species trait responses up to the community level.},

We studied sexual differences in hatching patterns and evaluated sex- and size-related mortality in relation to hatching order and brood sex ratios in the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica, a moderately size-dimorphic species, with a modal clutch size of 2 eggs. We found that male, second-hatched, and large eggs showed shorter hatching periods than female, first-hatched, and small eggs. We also found a male-biased mortality of nestlings in the colony. However, male mortality patterns differed depending on the brood sex ratio composition. Mortality of male chicks in all-male broods was higher than in mixed broods and higher than female mortality in all-female broods. Contrary, females from mixed brood showed higher mortality than their male nest mates and higher too than females in all-female broods. Second-hatched chicks also suffered from higher mortality than first-hatched chicks. Our results indicate that both the superior competitive capacity and the higher energy demand of the larger sex constitute 2 causal factors explaining patterns of sex-biased mortality. Both factors occur in the same species and in different situations of sibling competition shaped by brood sex ratio composition. This study constitutes a good example of how patterns of sex-related mortality can vary depending on nest environmental circumstances. Furthermore, our study suggests that hatching period can be a mechanism underlying sexual differences in the embryonic period of birds.},

  abstract = {Fires are an ecological process essential for species dependent on early successional habitat in forested landscapes. In a wildlife context, clearcut forestry practices can mimic forest fires through the creation of early successional forest clearings, however, evidence that clearcuts provide the same ecological value as fire is mixed. In temperate deciduous/hardwood forests, many species that depend on early successional habitat are known to use clearcuts, including Eastern Whip-poor-wills (Antrostomus vociferous) and Common Nighthawks (Chordeiles minor), two threatened aerial insectivorous birds. However, the relative importance of recent clearcuts as breeding habitat relative to other more naturally open habitat types in the boreal forest is unknown. In May-July 2015 we studied occupancy and detectability of these two species in the boreal forest of northwestern Ontario. We first determined whether occupancy differed among three open habitats: burned stands, recent clearcuts, and open wetlands, and whether it differed in relation to the size of clearcut patches. We also examined how detectability of each species varied with time of day, season and weather conditions. Site occupancy for the Eastern Whip-poorwill and Common Nighthawk averaged 0.413 and 0.437, respectively. We found no significant difference in occupancy of either species in relation to burned stands, recent clearcuts, or open wetlands, although Eastern Whip-poor-will occupancy tended to be higher in burned stands. Occupancy did not show a linear relationship with patch size but neither species was found in the smallest open patches ({$<$}3 ha), perhaps indicating a minimum size threshold, although further study is needed. The detection of each species was positively correlated with the occurrence of the other species, suggesting that they were both selecting similar site characteristics. Detectability for Eastern Whip-poor-will was highest after sunset and increased over the course of the breeding season, while for Common Nighthawk, detectability was similar during and after sunset and decreased over the season. Our results suggest that Eastern Whippoor-will and Common Nighthawk show similar preference for natural and managed open sites and that recent clearcuts may provide early successional habitat in the absence of burned stands. Our results also extend the known breeding range of Eastern Whip-poor-will, which further emphasizes the need for future research on these poorly studied species in the boreal forest.},

  abstract = {Predicting population-level effects from changes in demographic rates of different life stages is critical to prioritize conservation efforts. Demographic modeling and sensitivity analysis in particular, has become a standard tool to evaluate how management actions influence species' survival. Demographic analyses have resulted in the robust generalization that, for long-lived species with delayed reproduction, population growth rates will be most sensitive to changes in survivorship of older-aged individuals. Although useful in guiding management, this simple maxim may limit options for conservation by causing managers to overlook actions that, although possibly not the most effective in terms of increasing a population's growth rate in an ideal world, can nonetheless more feasibly and rapidly slow a population's decline. We examine the population-level benefits of increasing chick survival in a long-lived seabird, the Laysan albatross Phoebastria immutabilis. Specifically, we use a simple deterministic modeling approach to evaluate the impact of chick mortality (from ingestion of lead-based paint) on the population growth rate (l) for Laysan albatross that breed on Sand Island, Midway Atoll (part of the Hawaiian Archipelago). We estimate that up to 7\% of chicks on Sand Island fail to fledge as a result of lead poisoning, which will create a 16\% reduction in the Laysan albatross population size (\$190 000 less birds) at 50 years into the future. We demonstrate how straightforward management actions that increase juvenile survivorship (e.g. removal of lead-based paint) can help slow population declines while efforts are underway to reduce politically and logistically challenging threats to adult survivorship (e.g. mortality from international fisheries bycatch). Our work exemplifies a situation where overgeneralizations about demography can stifle useful conservation actions and highlights the need to consider the population-level benefits from multiple management strategies.},

To appropriately analyze these data, hierarchical models have been developed to separately model explanatory variables of both a latent abundance or occurrence process and a conditional detection process. Because these models have a straightforward interpretation paralleling mechanisms under which the data arose, they have recently gained immense popularity. The common hierarchical structure of these models is well-suited for a unified modeling interface.

  abstract = {This note describes nestling mortality in Arctic Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus tundrius) due to the biting effects of blood-feeding black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae). At a nest site near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada (62\textdegree 49{${'}$} N, 92\textdegree 05{${'}$} W), a brood of four nestlings died on 20 July 2013 from the direct effects of severe bites attributed to black flies. Within three hours of the onset of blood-feeding, black flies had caused widespread, uniformly distributed hemorrhagic coalescent lesions over the head and body of all nestlings. Approximately seven hours after the first flies appeared, the female falcon removed the carcasses of the dead nestlings from the nest. Nestlings at eight additional sites also suffered the effects of biting black flies in 2013, resulting in the deaths of 13 of 35 nestlings. A less pronounced outbreak also occurred in 2012 and resulted in the deaths of seven nestlings at four sites. No nestling mortality due to black flies has been documented in any other year from 1982 through 2015. To our knowledge, these observations document the northernmost lethal attack by ornithophilic black flies in North America.

Prey species sharing an enemy (predator or parasitoid) can be linked by apparent competition, but it is unknown whether this process is strong enough to be a community-wide structuring mechanism that could be used to predict future states of diverse food webs. Whether species abundances are spatially coupled by enemy movement across different habitats is also untested. Here, using a field experiment, we show that predicted apparent competitive effects between species, mediated via shared parasitoids, can significantly explain future parasitism rates and herbivore abundances. These predictions are successful even across edges between natural and managed forests, following experimental reduction of herbivore densities by aerial spraying of insecticide over 20\,hectares. This result shows that trophic indirect effects propagate across networks and habitats in important, predictable ways, with implications for landscape planning, invasion biology and biological control.},

  abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that ecosystems are not closed systems and that exchanges of resources across ecosystem boundaries can have repercussions on food webs, especially in low productivity systems such as the terrestrial Arctic. However, because these exchanges can take multiple forms, assessing their significance in the functioning of the tundra food web is difficult. In this paper, we first review some important concepts related to resource exchanges between ecosystems and examine their relevance to the study of trophic interactions in the arctic tundra. An analysis of the Bylot Island food web in the Canadian Arctic using a mass-balance trophic model suggests that predators are the dominant force controlling this food web. However, an important feature of this ecosystem is that several top predators benefit from allochthonous inputs, either through the presence of migratory birds during the summer or the use of the marine environment as a foraging ground in winter. We also show that migratory birds may act as autochthonous resource exporters for lower trophic levels, for instance by removing nitrogen from the nutrient pool when young produced locally migrate south and die away from the system. Although these resource exchanges may be a general feature of several arctic terrestrial ecosystems, their importance in the functioning of the tundra food web remains to be determined. Through long-term monitoring, we found that primary production in wetlands of Bylot Island increased by 85\% over a 20-y period, likely a consequence of the warming trend observed in the area. However, we have not detected any changes at higher trophic levels, which is consistent with a top-down control of this food web. Given the importance of resource exchanges between ecosystems in the dynamics of the tundra food web, a full investigation of the effects of climate change will require a broader cross-ecosystem perspective.},

We use the long-term (up to 24 years) monitoring records available on Bylot Island in the Canadian Arctic to examine temporal trends in population attributes of several terrestrial vertebrates and in primary production. Despite a warming trend (e.g. cumulative annual thawing degree-days increased by 37\% and snow-melt date advanced by 4\textendash 7 days over a 23-year period), we found little evidence for changes in the phenology, abundance or productivity of several vertebrate species (snow goose, foxes, lemmings, avian predators and one passerine). Only primary production showed a response to warming (annual above-ground biomass of wetland graminoids increased by 123\% during this period). We nonetheless found evidence for potential mismatches between herbivores and their food plants in response to warming as snow geese adjusted their laying date by only 3.8 days on average for a change in snow-melt of 10 days, half of the corresponding adjustment shown by the timing of plant growth (7.1 days). We discuss several reasons (duration of time series, large annual variability, amplitude of observed climate change, nonlinear dynamic or constraints imposed by various rate of warming with latitude in migrants) to explain the lack of response by herbivores and predators to climate warming at our study site. We also show how length and intensity of monitoring could affect our ability to detect temporal trends and provide recommendations for future monitoring.},

  abstract = {The high Arctic has the world's simplest terrestrial vertebrate predator\textendash prey community, with the collared lemming being the single main prey of four predators, the snowy owl, the Arctic fox, the long-tailed skua, and the stoat. Using a 20-year-long time series of population densities for the five species and a dynamic model that has been previously parameterized for northeast Greenland, we analyzed the population and community level consequences of the ongoing and predicted climate change. Species' responses to climate change are complex, because in addition to the direct effects of climate change, which vary depending on species' life histories, species are also affected indirectly due to, e.g., predator\textendash prey interactions. The lemming\textendash predator community exemplifies these complications, yet a robust conclusion emerges from our modeling: in practically all likely scenarios of how climate change may influence the demography of the species, climate change increases the length of the lemming population cycle and decreases the maximum population densities. The latter change in particular is detrimental to the populations of the predators, which are adapted to make use of the years of the greatest prey abundance. Therefore, climate change will indirectly reduce the predators' reproductive success and population densities, and may ultimately lead to local extinction of some of the predator species. Based on these results, we conclude that the recent anomalous observations about lack of cyclic lemming dynamics in eastern Greenland may well be the first signs of a severe impact of climate change on the lemming\textendash predator communities in Greenland and elsewhere in the high Arctic.},

Few, however, have investigated multitrophic systems, or the effects of both temperature and vertebrate grazing treatments on invertebrates. This study investigated trophic interactions between an herbivorous insect (Sitobion calvulum, Aphididae), a woody perennial host plant (Salix polaris) and a selective vertebrate grazer (barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis). In a factorial experiment, the responses of the insect and its host to elevated temperatures using open top chambers (OTCs) and to three levels of goose grazing pressure were assessed over two summer growing seasons (2004 and 2005). OTCs significantly enhanced the leaf phenology of Salix in both years and there was a significant OTC by goose presence interaction in 2004. Salix leaf number was unaffected by treatments in both years, but OTCs increased leaf size and mass in 2005. Salix reproduction and the phenology of flowers were unaffected by both treatments. Aphid densities were increased by OTCs but unaffected by goose presence in both years. While goose presence had little effect on aphid density or host plant phenology in this system, the OTC effects provide interesting insights into the possibility of phenological synchrony disruption. The advanced phenology of Salix effectively lengthens the growing season for the plant, but despite a close association with leaf maturity, the population dynamics of the aphid appeared to lack a similar phenological response, except for the increased population observed.},

  abstract = {The projected alterations to climate in the High Arctic are likely to result in changes to the short growing season, particularly with varying predicted effects on winter snowfall, the timing of summer snowmelt and air temperatures. These changes are likely to affect the phenology of interacting species in a variety of ways, but few studies have investigated the effects of combined climate drivers on plant\textendash pollinator interactions in the High Arctic. In this study, we alter the timing of flowering phenology using a field manipulation experiment in which snow depth is increased using snow fences and temperatures are enhanced by open-top chambers (OTCs). We used this experiment to quantify the combined effects of treatments on the flowering phenology of six dominant plant species (Dryas octopetala, Cassiope tetragona, Bistorta vivipara, Saxifraga oppositifolia, Stellaria crassipes and Pedicularis hirsuita), and to simulate differing responses to climate between plants and pollinators in a subset of plots. Flowers were counted regularly throughout the growing season of 2015, and insect visitors were caught on flowers during standardised observation sessions. As expected, deep snow plots had delayed snow melt timing and this in turn delayed the first and peak flowering dates of the plants and shortened the prefloration period overall. The OTCs counteracted the delay in first and peak flowering to some extent. There was no effect of treatment on length of flowering season, although for all variables there were species-specific responses. The insect flower\textendash visitor community was species poor, and although evidence of disruption to phenological overlaps was not found, the results do highlight the vulnerability of the plant\textendash pollinator network in this system with differing phenological shifts between insects and plants and reduced visitation rates to flowers in plots with deep snow.},

The models were developed using logistic regression and were based on current records of Greater rhea occurrence coupled with remote sensing data, including land cover and human presence variables. The habitat suitability maps generated were used to predict the suitable habitat patch structure for wild rhea populations in each area. Fifty-one percent of the total grassland area was suitable for the species, being represented by a single large patch that included 62\% of the individual locations. In the agro-ecosystem, only 28\% of the total area was suitable, which was distributed among four patches. Seventy percent of rhea observations were in suitable habitat, with all rheas grouped in the largest patch. Conservation efforts for preserving wild rhea populations should be focused on maintaining habitats similar to grasslands, which are less profitable for landowners at present. Consequently, the protection of the pampas grasslands, a key habitat for this species as well as for others with similar habitat requirements, will demand strong conservation actions through the reconciliation of interests between producers and conservationists, since the proportion of croplands is increasing.},

  abstract = {Brood reduction is a within-brood partial mortality due to sibling rivalry, and, in some species, the death of at least one sibling in the brood is almost guaranteed (obligate brood-reducers). Imperial Cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) usually lay three-egg clutches that hatch asynchronously over 4-5 days. This species exhibits obligate brood reduction, and last-laid (marginal) eggs serve as insurance against early failure of elder (core) members. Within-brood sibling asymmetries were manipulated to analyze their effects on breeding success, brood reduction, parental body condition and chick growth. Two types of symmetrical broods containing three similar-sized chicks at the beginning of chick-rearing (3-days old) and close to the peak in brood reduction (8-days old) were generated to contrast the natural asymmetrical brood. Breeding success and parental condition were unrelated to sibling asymmetry levels. Asymptotic mass of fledglings from 8-day old broods was lower than those for natural and 3-day old broods. Our results suggest that hatching asynchrony favors early brood reduction and improves fledging condition. Regardless of asymmetry levels, Imperial Cormorants were obligate reducers, and the insurance value provided by the marginal chick was negligible. Therefore, the insurance value of the marginal offspring appears to serve mainly at the egg stage. Received 3 February 2017, accepted 14 April 2017.},

Habitat quality reflects the extent to which the environmental characteristics of an area correspond to the preferred habitat characteristics of the species. The concentration of haemoglobin is considered a simple biochemical indicator of nestling body condition. We present results concerning the effects of variation in habitat characteristics on the concentration of haemoglobin in the blood of 14-day-old nestlings and breeding success of European Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in a mature mixed deciduous forest in central Poland. The haemoglobin concentration of nestlings was higher when there were more native oaks and deciduous, native trees on the territory. Breeding success was reduced by the number of alien oak (the Red Oak, Quercus rubra) and other alien deciduous trees, but increased by the number of native oaks in the territory. This study was conducted on only one site so further research is needed to examine the broader applicability of our results. Our data support the idea that haemoglobin concentration may serve as a simple indicator of body condition in nestlings and is useful in field ecophysiology studies of European Pied Flycatchers.},

Chick mortality affected 9.3\% of hatchlings and 13.9\% of the nests monitored. Sibling aggression was the most important factor in brood reduction (54.8\% mortality of chicks in the nest), and supplementary feeding limited the process of sibling aggression. In addition, we compared the fledging rate in nests with supplementary food to that of non-supplemented control nests. Supplementary food increased the number of fledglings per brood (1.56 vs 0.72 in the control nests). This increase was repeated in subadult pairs (1.57 vs 0.53 in the control nests) and occurred both in high-quality territories (2.32 vs 1.36) and in low-quality territories (1.35 vs 0.54). Our results also suggest that supplementary feeding does not appear to have any effect on the provisioning rate of either males or females or on the wild prey. Food supplementation led to the recovery of breeding success after a period of loss due to a reduction of prey as a consequence of viral haemorrhagic disease. We conclude that the Spanish imperial eagle's breeding output is food-limited during the nestling period and that food taken to the nest regulates sibling aggression. Supplemental feeding when food is scarce, or under emergency conditions, can be considered a good management tool for the conservation of this endangered species.},

This paper reviews the direct effects of climate on both crop growth and yield and on plant pests and pathogens and the interactions that may occur between crops, pests, and pathogens under changed climate. Finally, we consider the contribution that better understanding of the roles of pests and pathogens in crop production systems might make to enhanced food security. Evidence for the measured climate change on crops and their associated pests and pathogens is starting to be documented. Globally atmospheric [CO2] has increased, and in northern latitudes mean temperature at many locations has increased by about 1.0\textendash 1.4 \textdegree C with accompanying changes in pest and pathogen incidence and to farming practices. Many pests and pathogens exhibit considerable capacity for generating, recombining, and selecting fit combinations of variants in key pathogenicity, fitness, and aggressiveness traits that there is little doubt that any new opportunities resulting from climate change will be exploited by them. However, the interactions between crops and pests and pathogens are complex and poorly understood in the context of climate change. More mechanistic inclusion of pests and pathogen effects in crop models would lead to more realistic predictions of crop production on a regional scale and thereby assist in the development of more robust regional food security policies.},

Despite their importance for understanding global ecological and evolutionary processes, plant-animal interaction gradients are particularly difficult to test systematically across large geographic gradients, and evidence from smaller, disparate studies is inconclusive. By systematically measuring postdispersal seed predation using 6995 standardized seed depots along 18 mountains in the Pacific cordillera, we found that seed predation increases by 17\% from the Arctic to the Equator and by 17\% from 4000 meters above sea level to sea level. Clines in total predation, likely driven by invertebrates, were consistent across treeline ecotones and within continuous forest and were better explained by climate seasonality than by productivity, biodiversity, or latitude. These results suggest that species interactions play predictably greater ecological and evolutionary roles in tropical, lowland, and other less seasonal ecosystems. Alaska to Ecuador mega-experiment shows seeds are more likely to be munched toward the tropics and lowlands, as Darwin predicted.

  abstract = {Relative abundance indices are often used to compare species abundance between sites. The indices assume that species have similar detection probabilities, or that differences between detection probabilities are known and can be corrected for. Indices often consist of encounter frequencies of footprints, burrows, markings or photo captures along trails or transect lines, but the assumption of equal detection probabilities is rarely validated. This study analyzes detection probabilities of a range of Neotropical mammals on trails in dense secondary forests, using camera-trap and track data. Photo captures of the two large cats, jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor), were correlated solely with trail variables, while photo captures of their potential prey species had no correlation or negative correlation with trail variables. The Neotropical mammals varied greatly in their tendency to follow or cross trails based on footprints surveys. This indicates that camera locations on trails will have varying detection probability for these Neotropical mammals. Even the two similar-sized jaguars and pumas, occupying relatively similar niches, differed subtly in their use of trails. Pumas followed trails more completely while jaguars were more likely to deviate from trails. The ecological significance of these findings is that jaguars seem to be more willing to use the forest matrix away from trails than do pumas. We conclude that trail-based indices, such as photographic captures or tracks along trails, are not appropriate for comparison between Neotropical species, and not even between relatively similar species like jaguars and pumas.},

  abstract = {Northwestern Canada is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. The scale and rapidity of recently observed warming-induced changes throughout this region indicate that it is particularly sensitive to climate warming and capable of rapid responses to perturbations. Unprecedented rates of permafrost thaw in the zone of discontinuous permafrost are transforming forests to wetlands, and changing the distribution and routing of water over the landscape as evidenced by recent increases in basin discharge. However, the impact of increasing basin discharge on basin water storage is not well understood. Water levels on a permafrost plateau, channel fen, and isolated and connected bogs were monitored from 2003\textendash 2017 in the Scotty Creek watershed, Northwest Territories. The water level in the channel fen did not significantly change over the period of study, sustained by inputs from the increasingly-connected network of bogs as permafrost barriers thawed. Bogs with varying levels of connection to the drainage network released from storage between 40 and 53 mm of water over the study period. The water level in the monitored isolated bog did not significantly change over this period. Estimates of moisture contributions derived directly from vertical permafrost thaw and from the lateral expansion of contributing areas account for 90\% of the observed cumulative increase of 1043 mm in basin runoff between 1998\textendash 2012, leaving 109 mm of this increase unaccounted for. Increasing connectivity to the drainage network and transient wetland drainage at the landscape scale resulted from permafrost thaw-induced talik development. The similarity between the magnitude of wetland drainage and that of enhanced runoff suggests that increased connectivity of wetlands to the drainage network may contribute to increasing runoff from the Scotty Creek watershed. Permafrost thaw-induced land cover transition was found to have both short and long-term effects on runoff generation.},

In these surveys, animals are typically counted regardless of their distance from the survey point. When these surveys are carried out in patchy habitat or near edges, detected individuals may frequently occur in a different land-cover type than the survey point itself, which introduces uncertainty regarding species-habitat associations. We propose a method to restrict detections from single microphones to within a pre-specified survey radius. The method uses logistic regression to select a sound level threshold corresponding to the desired distance threshold. We applied this method to acoustic data from the centre of 21 1-ha oil wellsites in northern Alberta. To compare our approach with the results from auditory surveys from the same locations, we used sound localisation to locate birds detected via both methods. Just 22.4\% of birds detected on auditory surveys fell within the desired survey area. Using our distance-truncation method, 96\% of detections were within the desired survey area. We propose that distance truncation via sound level will be useful for surveys of patchily distributed habitat, or when greater certainty about bird locations or habitat associations is desired.},

  abstract = {As a consequence of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, climate change is predicted to be particularly pronounced, although regionally variable, in the vast arctic, sub-arctic and alpine tundra areas of the northern hemisphere. Here, we review winter foraging conditions for reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) living in these areas, and consider diet, forage quality and distribution, accessibility due to snow variation, and effects of snow condition on reindeer and caribou populations. Finally, we hypothesise how global warming may affect wild mountain reindeer herds in South Norway. Energy-rich lichens often dominate reindeer and caribou diets. The animals also prefer lichens, and their productivity has been shown to be higher on lichen-rich than on lichen-poor ranges. Nevertheless, this energy source appears to be neither sufficient as winter diet for reindeer or caribou (at least for pregnant females) nor necessary. Some reindeer and caribou populations seem to be better adapted to a non-lichen winter diet, e.g. by a larger alimentary tract. Shrubs appear to be the most common alternative winter forage, while some grasses appear to represent a good, nutritionally-balanced winter diet. Reindeer/caribou make good use of a wide variety of plants in winter, including dead and dry parts that are digested more than expected based on their fibre content. The diversity of winter forage is probably important for the mineral content of the diet. A lichen-dominated winter diet may be deficient in essential dietary elements, e.g. minerals. Sodium in particular may be marginal in inland winter ranges. Our review indicates that most Rangifer populations with lichen-dominated winter diets are either periodically or continuously heavily harvested by humans or predators. However, when population size is mainly limited by food, accessible lichen resources are often depleted. Plant studies simulating climatic change indicate that a warmer, wetter climate may cause an altitudinal upward shift in the production of mat-forming lichens in alpine, sub-arctic regions. This is due to an increased potential for lichen growth at high altitudes, combined with increased competition from taller-growing vascular plants at lower altitudes, where the biomass of Betula nana in particular will increase. Matforming lichens dominant on dry, windblown ridges are easily overgrazed at high reindeer densities. This has longterm effects due to lichens' slow regeneration rate, but may also reduce competition from vascular plants in a long time perspective. Fires may act in a similar way in some forested areas. Accessibility of winter forage depends on plant biomass, snow depth and hardness; ice crusts or exceptionally deep snow may result in starvation and increased animal mortality. Calf recruitment appears to be low and/or highly variable where winter ranges are overgrazed and hard or deep snow is common. Population decline in several Rangifer tarandus spp. has been associated with snow-rich winters. Effects tend to be delayed and cumulative, particularly on calves. This is mainly ascribed to feeding conditions for young animals which later affect age at maturation. Global warming may increase the frequency of deep or hard snow on reindeer ranges in Norway, due to increased precipitation and more frequent mild periods in winter. We hypothesise that potential benefits from increased plant productivity due to global warming will be counteracted by shifts in the distribution of preferred lichen forage, reduction of the areas of suitable winter ranges, and generally reduced forage accessibility in winter.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Baiting red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) is an established method of vaccinating foxes against rabies in rural environments. Furthermore, anthelmintic baiting has been demonstrated to reduce the prevalence of the zoonotic tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis in foxes. The recent invasion of foxes into urban areas on continental Europe represents a considerable health risk that calls for the evaluation of baiting strategies adapted to the urban environment. We investigated bait uptake by urban foxes using camera traps in Zurich, Switzerland. Baits with and without the anthelmintic praziquantel were placed in several arrangements (exposed, covered, buried), at different locations (fox dens, compost heaps, fox tracks) and in different seasons (early summer, summer, winter). Ninetyone of 252 baits (36\%) disappeared within 3 days. Most of the baits consumed near cameras were consumed by foxes (44 of 91). The remaining baits were consumed by hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), snails (Arion sp.), dogs, rodents (Apodemus sp.), and unidentified animals. Bait uptake by foxes was significantly higher during summer than winter (P = 0.022), and foxes accepted baits most frequently at fox dens during early summer (52.8\%). Burying baits reduced bait removal by species other than foxes (P {$<$} 0.01). For rabies control in urban areas, avoiding contact of nontarget species with the rabies vaccine is particularly important. Greater selection of the fox population can be achieved by distributing baits in winter, burying baits, and choosing sites that are less accessible to non-target species. However, with anthelmintic treatment, uptake by nontarget species is of lesser importance; hence, the effort to bury the bait is unnecessary.},

  abstract = {The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in late 1990 at a meeting of arctic tundra ecologists as a response to predictions that the human-enhanced greenhouse warming would occur earliest and most intensely at high latitudes. The initial objective of ITEX was to monitor phenology, growth and reproduction in major circumpolar vascular plant species in response to climate variations and environmental manipulations at sites throughout the tundra biome. The manipulations involve passive warming of tundra plots in open-top chambers (OTCs), and manipulating snow depth to alter growing season length. Standard protocols were developed for measurements, experimental design and statistical analyses, and published in an ITEX Manual. The standard methods ensure comparable data are collected at all sites. This special issue of Global Change Biology is based on papers developed from the 6th ITEX Workshop, held at the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada, 7\textendash 11 April 1995. The papers compare shortterm responses (1\textendash 3 years) of common species to climate variations and manipulations at ITEX sites. The OTCs increase mean near-surface temperatures by 1\textendash 3\textdegree C during the growing season, simulating predictions from global circulation models. All species investigated responded to the temperature increase, especially in phenology and reproductive variables. However, these short-term responses were individualistic, and no general pattern in type or magnitude of response was noted for functional types or phenology class. Responses were generally similar among sites, although the magnitude of response tended to be greater in high Arctic sites. Early snowmelt increased carbon : nutrient ratios in plants. Sustained growth and reproductive responses to warming will depend on nutrient supply, and increased carbon : nutrient ratios in litter could buffer nutrient cycling, and hence plant growth. Ongoing, long-term research at ITEX sites, linked to other global change initiatives, will help elucidate probable effects of climate change at the ecosystems level in arctic and alpine tundra.},

  abstract = {Mapping and monitoring land cover and land cover change remains a top priority for land managers. Uniquely, remote sensing offers the capacity to acquire information in a systematic (spatially, temporally, and categorically) and synoptic fashion that is appealing from monitoring and reporting perspectives. The opening of the Landsat archive and new processing and analysis opportunities enable the characterization of large areas and the generation of dynamic, transparent, systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive information products. Best Available Pixel (BAP) approaches enable the production of periodic image composites free of haze, clouds, or shadows over large areas. In this paper we demonstrate an integrated protocol to produce spatially exhaustive annual BAP image composites that are seasonally constrained and free of atmospheric perturbations. These annual BAP composites for the years inclusive of 1998 to 2010 provide for generation of a suite of change metrics for the period 2000 to 2010 using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data. The study area is the {$>$} 375,000 km2 forested area of Saskatchewan, Canada. We evaluate the robustness of the protocol by comparing in-filled (or proxy) values with a true reference set for surface reflectance. An initial change detection pass is used to aid in the allocation of proxy values (for missing and anomalous values) and to allocate change events to the correct year, with a second pass to characterize key change points and related time series trends (e.g., change year, post-change slopes, among others). In so doing, a multi-temporal data cube (via a series of annual proxy composites) and a set of change metrics are generated. Approximately 35\% of the pixels in our study area required proxy values, either as a result of missing data or our noise detection approach. Overall, our results indicate strong agreement between the assigned proxy values and the reference data (R = 0.71\textendash{} 0.91, RMSE = 0.008\textendash 0.025). Agreement was stronger for pixel series with no change events (R = 0.73\textendash 0.92, RMSE = 0.007\textendash 0.024), relative to pixel series with change events (R = 0.63\textendash 0.87, RMSE = 0.010\textendash 0.029). The generated change metrics, derived via temporal and spatial analysis of the annual BAP composites, were an important precursor to the generation of valid proxy values, and \textendash{} importantly \textendash{} provide valuable information for the further assessment and understanding of land cover and land cover change. Our results indicate that the demonstrated protocol provides a reliable approach to generate proxy image composites containing no data gaps, along with a suite of informative change metrics that provide a comprehensive characterization of land cover changes (including disturbance and recovery) allowing for an improved understanding of landscape dynamics. The protocol is efficient and may be applied over large areas to support regional and national mapping and monitoring activities.},

Since 1969, my colleagues and I have been studying migratory songbird populations in their breeding quarters at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in north-central New Hampshire, USA, and since 1986, in their winter quarters in the Greater Antilles (Jamaica). Long-term data on the abundance and demography of these populations, coupled with experimental tests of mechanisms, indicate that processes operating in the breeding area (e.g. density-dependent fecundity, food limitation) are sufficient to limit and regulate the local abundance of these species. At the same time, limiting factors operating in the non-breeding season (e.g. climate-induced food limitation in winter quarters and especially mortality during migration) also have important impacts on migrant populations. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that limiting processes during the winter period can carry over into the breeding season and affect reproductive output. These findings clearly demonstrate that to understand changes in abundance of long-distance migrant species requires knowledge of events operating throughout the annual cycle, which presents a challenge to researchers, managers and others concerned with the welfare of these species.},

  abstract = {Post-dispersal seed predation is only one of many factors underlying plant demography and evolution. Nevertheless, the generalist feeding habits of many post-dispersal seed predators and the limited ability of plants either to compensate for or to respond to post-dispersal seed losses directly suggest that post-dispersal seed predation may have a considerable impact on plant populations. Seed predators probably have little direct influence on the demography of plants that regenerate exclusively by vegetative means or are buffered by a large active seed bank, but such species are only a minority in most plant communities. In general, ants are significant post-dispersal seed predators in arid and semi-arid ecosystems while they act mainly as seed dispersers rather than as predators in temperate ecosystems. Although studies have probably underestimated the importance of invertebrates and birds as seed predators, rodents appear to have greater potential to influence seed dynamics, and are particularly important in temperate ecosystems. For example, production of mast seed crops is more effective at satiating specialist invertebrate seed predators than generalist vertebrates, and recruitment may be limited by post-dispersal seed predation even during mast years. Both spatial variation in post-dispersal seed predation and differences in predation between species are important elements which facilitate the coexistence of different plant species. Where microsites are limiting, selective post-dispersal seed predators can influence pre-emptive competition for these microsites. Seed size determines the extent of density-dependent predation and the exploitation of buried seed. This suggests that post-dispersal seed predators may also play a role in the evolution of seed characteristics. However, conclusions regarding the ecological and evolutionary impact of post-dispersal seed predators will remain speculative without a more substantial empirical base.},

  abstract = {Adult peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus macropus) have monotypic plumage and display strong reversed sexual dimorphism, with females significantly larger than males. Reversed sexual dimorphism is measurable among nestlings in the latter stages of their development and can therefore be used to differentiate between sexes. In the early stages of development, however, nestlings cannot be sexed with any degree of certainty because morphological differentiation between the sexes is not well developed. During this study we developed a model for sexing younger nestlings based on genetic analysis and morphometric data collected as part of a long-term banding study of this species. A discriminant function model based on morphological characteristics was developed for determining the sex of nestlings (n = 150) in the field and was shown to be 96.0\% accurate. This predictive model was further tested against an independent morphometric dataset taken from a second group of nestlings (n = 131). The model correctly allocated sex to 96.2\% of this second group of nestlings. Sex can reliably be determined (98.6\% accurate) for nestlings that have a wing length of at least 9 cm using this model. Application of this model, therefore, allows the banding of younger nestlings and, as such, significantly increases the period of time over which banding can occur. Another important implication of this model is that by banding nestlings earlier, they are less likely to jump from the nest, therefore reducing the risk of injury to both the brood and the bander.},

We give an overview of tundra species that exhibit population cycles and describe what are currently believed to be the causal mechanisms. Population cycles most likely originate from trophic interactions within the plant-based tundra food web, where lemmings, either as prey for carnivores or as consumers of plants, play the key role. The predominance of trophic interaction cycles at northern latitudes is ultimately related to climate, and such cycles should therefore be vulnerable to climate change. Recent evidence indicates that changes have already taken place in the dynamics of some key herbivores and their predators, consistent with the expected impacts of climate change. There is a strong need for large-scale integrated monitoring and research efforts to further document such changes and their ecosystem consequences.},

As a direct result to this finding, the Arctic Raptor Project was established in 1982, and its goal was to monitor the breeding success of Arcticnesting peregrine falcons (F.p. tundrius). The present article provides a synopsis of the major findings of its research, which was principally conducted around Rankin Inlet (Nunavut), but also, more recently, around Igloolik and on Baffin Island (Nunavut). The results cover raptor feeding regimes, reproductive phenology, growth and survival of young, and population dynamics. The long-term Rankin Inlet study has identified, among other things, a decrease in the number of young fledged over the past 3 decades. Episodes of heavy summer rain, which have occurred more frequently in recent years, appear, in part, to be responsible for this decline in reproductive output. The continued study of Arctic-nesting raptors is crucial to our understanding of population dynamics, including how these are affected by changes in climate and in the environment (e.g., reductions in organochloride pollutant levels), and on the structure and functioning of the Arctic ecosystem.},

Results are from analyzing interannual satellite records of vegetation greenness across a bioclimate gradient of the Canadian Arctic over the period of 1982\textendash 2006. Here, we combine multi-scale sub-pixel analysis and remote sensing time-series analysis to investigate recent decadal changes in vegetation greenness along spatial gradients of summer temperature and vegetation. Linear autoregression temporal analysis of vegetation greenness was performed with relatively ``pure'' vegetation pixels of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, spanning Low Arctic, High Arctic and polar desert ecosystems. Vegetation greenness generally increased over tundra ecosystems in the past two decades. Peak annual greenness increased 0.49\textendash 0.79\%/yr over the High Arctic where prostrate dwarf shrubs, forbs, mosses and lichens dominate and 0.46\textendash 0.67\%/yr over the Low Arctic where erect dwarf shrubs and graminoids dominate. However, magnitudes of vegetation greenness differ with length of time series and periods considered, indicating a nonlinear response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. The decadal increases of greenness reflect increasing vegetation production during the peak of the growing season, and were likely driven by the recent warming.},

However, our understanding of the impact of winter on these cycles is increasingly uncertain, especially because climate change is affecting snow predictability, quality, and abundance. We examined the role of winter weather and snow conditions, the lack of suitable habitat structure during freeze-\-thaw periods, and the lack of sufficient food as potential causes for winter population crashes. We live-\- trapped bank voles Myodes glareolus on 26 plots (0.36 ha each) at two different elevations (representing different winter conditions) in southeast Norway in the winters 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. We carried out two manipulations: supplementing six plots with food to eliminate food limitation and six plots with straw to improve habitat structure and limit the effect of icing in the subnivean space. In the first winter, all bank voles survived well on all plots, whereas in the second winter voles on almost all plots went extinct except for those receiving supplemental food. Survival was highest on the feeding treatment in both winters, whereas improving habitat structure had no effect. We conclude that food limitation was a key factor in causing winter population crashes.},

Advocates of the multiple organism approach argue that the use of different organism groups should strengthen inference-based models and ultimately result in lower assessment error, while opponents argue that organism groups often respond similarly to stress implying a high degree of redundancy. Using fish, macroinvertebrate, macrophyte and benthic diatom data, site-specific parameters (e.g., water chemistry and substratum) and catchment variables from European mountain (n=77) and lowland (n=85) streams we evaluated the discriminatory power and uncertainty associated with the use of a number of biological metrics commonly used in stream assessment. The primary environmental gradient for both streams types was land use and nutrient enrichment. Secondary and tertiary gradients were related to habitat quality or alterations in hydromorphology. Benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate metrics showed high discriminatory power (R2 values often {$>$}0.50) and low error ({$<$}30\%) with the primary (nutrient) gradient, while both fish and macrophyte metrics performed relatively poorly. Conversely, both fish and macrophyte metrics showed higher response (high coefficients of determination) than either benthic diatom or macroinvertebrate metrics to the second (e.g., alteration in habitat/hydromorphology) gradient. However, the discriminatory power and error associated with individual metrics varied markedly, indicating that caution should be exercised when selecting the `best' organism group or metric to monitor stress.},

Using a dataset consisting of four organism groups (fish, macrophytes, benthic diatoms and macroinvertebrates) and catchment, riparian and in-stream physico-chemical variables from 77 mountain and 85 lowland streams we determined the relationships between indicator response and complex environmental gradients. The upper ({$>$}75th percentile) and lower ({$<$}25th percentiles) tails of principal component (PC) gradients were used to study the early response of the four organism groups to stress. An organism/metric was considered as an early warning indicator if the response to the short gradients was more robust (higher R2 values, steeper slope and lower error) than the null model (organism response to the full PC gradient). For mountain streams, both fish and macrophyte CA scores were shown to exhibit an early warning response to the upper tail of the 1st PC gradient when compared to the null model. Five of the eight metrics showed better response to the upper tail of the 2nd PC gradient compared to the null model, while only one metric (macrophyte CA scores) showed improvement when compared to the lower tail of the 2nd PC gradient. For lowland streams all four organism-groups showed better response (CA scores) to the upper tail of the PC gradient when compared to the null model. Only one metric (fish CA scores) regressed against the lower tail of the 2nd PC gradient was found to be more robust than the PC2 null model. These findings indicate that the nonlinear relationships of organism/metric response to stress can be used to select potentially robust early warning indicators for monitoring and assessment.},

Alterations of these pathways could be especially intense in ecosystems characterized by a simple trophic structure and rapid warming trends, such as in the Arctic. However, quantifying the multiple direct and indirect pathways through which climate change is likely to alter trophic interactions and their relative strength remains a challenge. Here, we aim to identify direct and indirect causal mechanisms driven by climate affecting predator\textendash prey interactions of species sharing a tundra food web. We based our study on relationships between one Arctic predator (Arctic fox) and its two main prey \textendash{} lemmings (preferred prey) and snow geese (alternate prey) \textendash{} which are exposed to variable local and regional climatic factors across years. We used a combination of models mapping multiple causal links among key variables derived from a long-term dataset (21 years). We obtained several possible scenarios linking regional climate factors (Arctic oscillations) and local temperature and precipitation to the breeding of species. Our results suggest that both regional and local climate factors have direct and indirect impacts on the breeding of foxes and geese. Local climate showed a positive causal link with goose nesting success, while both regional and local climate displayed contrasted effects on the proportion of fox breeding. We found no impact of climate on lemming abundance. We observed positive relationships between lemming, fox and goose reproduction highlighting numerical and functional responses of fox to the variability of lemming abundance. Our study measures causal links and strength of interactions in a food web, quantifying both numerical response of a predator and apparent interactions between its two main prey. These results improve our understanding of the complex effects of climate on predator\textendash prey interactions and our capacity to anticipate food web response to ongoing climate change.},

With the rapidly increasing human population, a corresponding increa demand for food, fuel, and shelter; habitat destruction; and increased competition for natural resources, the health a well-being of wild animal populations is increasingly at risk of disease and endangerment. Scientific data are nee to measure the impact that human encroachment is having on wildlife. Nonbiased biom?trie data provide a means to measure the amount of stress being imposed on animals from humans, the environment, and other animals. The str response in animals functions via glucocorticoid metabolism and is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adre axis. Fecal glucocorticoids, in particular, may be an extremely useful biom?trie test, since sample collection is nonin vasive to subjects and, therefore, does not introduce other variables that may alter assay results. For this reason, m researchers and conservationists have begun to use fecal glucocorticoids as a means to measure stress in various anim species. This review article summarizes the literature on many studies in which fecal glucocorticoids and their meta olites have been used to assess stress levels in various mammalian species. Variations between studies are the m focus of this review. Collection methods, storage conditions, shipping procedures, and laboratory techniques util by different researchers are discussed.

We color-banded 128 shrikes during 2007\textendash 2009. The breeding season lasted from late February until late June. We found 34 nests and a correlation between years with amount of precipitation and number of breeding pairs. Second broods after successful broods were found only in 2007 and were all unsuccessful. Most nests were in Acacia trees; pairs that nested in dry trees, lacking foliage, were more likely to fail. The average clutch size was 3.44; average number of nestlings was 1.95; and average number of nestlings that fledged was 1.24. These results are lower than other studies of the species, probably a result of the scarcity of food in the arid environment. Nest survival rate was higher during incubation than during rearing of nestlings (0.71vs. 0.62), and total nest survival was 44.5\%. The arid Arava Valley influences breeding success of Southern Grey Shrikes, and the present severe drought could negatively influence persistence of the shrike population in the Arava Valley.

  abstract = {Understanding the distribution and function of Arctic and boreal ecosystems under current conditions and their vulnerability to altered forcing is crucial to our assessment of future global environmental change. Such efforts can be facilitated by the development and application of ecological models that simulate realistic patterns of vegetation change at high latitudes. This paper reviews three classes of ecological models that have been implemented to extrapolate vegetation information in space (e.g. across the Arctic and adjacent domains) and over historical and future periods (e.g. under altered climate and other forcings). These are: (i) equilibrium biogeographical models; (ii) frame-based transient ecosystem models, and (iii) dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). The equilibrium response of high-latitude vegetation to scenarios of increased surface air temperatures projected by equilibrium biogeographical models is for tundra to be replaced by a northward shift of boreal woodland and forests. A frame-based model (ALFRESCO) indicates the same directional changes, but illustrates how response time depends on rate of temperature increase and concomitant changes in moisture regime and \textregistered re disturbance return period. Key disadvantages of the equilibrium models are that they do not simulate time-dependent responses of vegetation and the role of disturbance is omitted or highly generalized. Disadvantages of the frame-based models are that vegetation type is modelled as a set unit as opposed to an association of individually simulated plant functional types and that the role of ecosystem biogeochemistry in succession is not explicitly considered. DGVMs explicitly model disturbance (e.g. \textregistered re), operate on plant functional types, and incorporate constraints of nutrient availability on biomass production in the simulation of vegetation dynamics. Under changing climate, DGVMs detail conversion of tundra to tree-dominated boreal landscapes along with time-dependent responses of biomass, net primary production, and soil organic matter turnover\DH which all increase with warming. Key improvements to DGVMs that are needed to portray behaviour of arctic and boreal ecosystems adequately are the inclusion of anaerobic soil processes for inundated landscapes, permafrost dynamics, and moss-lichen layer biogeochemistry, as well as broader explicit accounting of disturbance regimes (including insect outbreaks and land management). Transient simulation of these landscapes can be further tailored to high-latitude processes and issues by spatially interactive, gridded application of arctic/boreal frame-based models and development of dynamic regional vegetation models (DRVMs) utilizing plant functional type schemes that capture the variety of high-latitude environments.},

Observations on the distribution and frequency of vascular plants were performed on 23 mountains situated along a west\textendash east gradient in Jotunheimen, central Norway, where detailed site descriptions and species lists exist from ad 1930\textendash 31. The sites were resurveyed during the summer of 1998, to examine possible changes in species richness and species distributions along the altitudinal gradient during a 68-year period. Increased species richness was found on 19 of the mountains and was most pronounced at lower altitudes and in the eastern areas. Lowland species, dwarf shrubs and species with wide altitudinal and ecological ranges showed the greatest increases in abundance and altitudinal advances since the 1930\textendash 31 study. Species with more restricted habitat demands, such as some hygrophilous snow-bed species, have declined. High-altitude species have disappeared from their lower-elevation sites and increased their abundance at the highest altitudes. Climatic warming occurring in the last 100 years might have allowed the invasion of lowland and lee-slope species. Increased competition at sites where such species have invaded may have led to a decreased abundance of the less competitive species and a concentration of high-altitude species on the highest ridges. Natural succession since the `Little Ice Age', increased deposition of nitrogen during recent years and changes in grazing and tourism might have in uenced some of the species turnovers, but recent climatic changes are considered to be the most likely major driving factor for the changes observed.},

  abstract = {Ecologists that study the population dynamics of large and small herbivorous mammals operate in two worlds that overlap only partly, and in this paper I address whether the conjecture that these worlds represent two distinct and valid paradigms is currently justified. I argue that large mammals fall into three groups depending on whether they have effective predators or not, and whether they are harvested by humans. Because of human persecution of large predators, more and more large herbivorous mammals are effectively predator-free and are controlled bottom-up by food. But in less disturbed systems, large herbivorous mammals should be controlled top-down by effective predators, and this can lead to a trophic cascade. Small herbivorous mammals have been suggested to be controlled top-down by predators but some experimental evidence has challenged this idea and replaced it with the notion that predation is one of several factors that may affect rates of population increase. Intrinsic control (territoriality, infanticide, social inhibition of breeding) appears to be common in small herbivorous mammals with altricial young but is absent in species with precocial young, in ecosystems with strong stochastic weather variation (deserts) and in areas of human-induced habitat fragmentation in agricultural monocultures. The extrinsic control of large herbivores with precocial young validates part of Graeme Caughley's Grand Vision, but the relative role of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms for small herbivores with altricial young is still controversial. An improved knowledge of population control mechanisms for large and small herbivores is essential for natural resource management.},

  abstract = {Despite extensive research on the topic, it has been difficult to reach general conclusions as to the effects of climate change on morphology in wild animals: in particular, the effects of warming temperatures have been associated with increases, decreases or stasis in body size in different populations. Here, we use a fine-scale analysis of associations between weather and offspring body size in a long-term study of a wild passerine bird, the cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wren, in south-eastern Australia to show that such variation in the direction of associations occurs even within a population. Over the past 26 years, our study population has experienced increased temperatures, increased frequency of heatwaves and reduced rainfall \textendash{} but the mean body mass of chicks has not changed. Despite the apparent stasis, mass was associated with weather across the previous year, but in multiple counteracting ways. Firstly, (i) chick mass was negatively associated with extremely recent heatwaves, but there also positive associations with (ii) higher maximum temperatures and (iii) higher rainfall, both occurring in a period prior to and during the nesting period, and finally (iv) a longer-term negative association with higher maximum temperatures following the previous breeding season. Our results illustrate how a morphological trait may be affected by both short- and long-term effects of the same weather variable at multiple times of the year and that these effects may act in different directions. We also show that climate within the relevant time windows may not be changing in the same way, such that overall long-term temporal trends in body size may be minimal. Such complexity means that analytical approaches that search for a single `best' window for one particular weather variable may miss other relevant information, and is also likely to make analyses of phenotypic plasticity and prediction of longer-term population dynamics difficult.},

  abstract = {Future changes in precipitation intensity over the Arctic were calculated based on three-member ensemble simulations using a global atmospheric model with a high horizontal resolution (60-km grid) for the period 1872e2099 (228 years). During 1872e2005, the model was forced with observed historical sea surface temperature (SST) data, while during 2006e2099, boundary SST data were estimated using the multi-model ensemble (MME) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 3 (CMIP3) model, assuming the A1B emission scenario. The annual mean precipitation (PAVE), the simple daily precipitation intensity index (SDII), and the maximum 5-day precipitation total (R5d) averaged over the Arctic increased monotonically towards the end of the 21st century. Over the Arctic, the conversion rate from water vapor to precipitation per one degree temperature increase is larger for PAVE than for R5d, which is opposite to the tropics and mid-latitudes. The increases in PAVE, SDII, and R5d can be partly attributed to an increase in water vapor associated with increasing temperatures, and to an increase in the horizontal transport of water vapor from low to high latitudes associated with transient eddies.},

  abstract = {Climate warming is occurring at an unprecedented rate in the Arctic and is having profound effects on host-parasite interactions, including range expansion. Recently, two species of protostrongylid nematodes have emerged for the first time in muskoxen and caribou on Victoria Island in the western Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis, the muskox lungworm, was detected for the first time in 2008 in muskoxen at a community hunt on the southwest corner of the island and by 2012, it was found several hundred kilometers east in commercially harvested muskoxen near the town of Ikaluktutiak. In 2010, Varestrongylus sp., a recently discovered lungworm of caribou and muskoxen was found in muskoxen near Ikaluktutiak and has been found annually in this area since then. Whereas invasion of the island by U. pallikuukensis appears to have been mediated by stochastic movement of muskoxen from the mainland to the southwest corner of the island, Varestrongylus has likely been introduced at several times and locations by the seasonal migration of caribou between the island and the mainland. A newly permissive climate, now suitable for completion of the parasite life cycles in a single summer, likely facilitated the initial establishment and now drives range expansion for both parasites.},

  abstract = {The population cycles of microtine rodents in northern Finland have been continuously followed since the late 1940's. Plant reproduction (flowering, berry and seed production, and the subsequent formation of young rhizomes etc.) has been monitored since 1972. Cycles of sympatric microtines were synchronous and were characterized by synchronous changes in the condition of the rodents. These facts cannot be explained by intrinsic factors, competition or predation only. Plants are also characterized by "cyclicity" in reproduction and growth, which are synchronous among many plant species. The basic rhythm is not modified by rodents. The short growing season is considered to be a primary factor for cyclic reproduction in plants. Plants need to accumulate reserves for several summers before they are able to flower, and this accumulation and exhaustion of resources is reflected in microtine nutrition and population dynamics. There seems to be a threshold level of temperature sums which activates flowering. Changes in food supply (plant rhythms, local overgrazing, defence) are the primary factors triggering the population decline. Other extrinsic factors such as predation and possibly diseases contribute to the depth of the decline. ///

Across the Pan-Arctic, vegetation productivity and surface greenness have trended positively over the period of satellite observation. However, since 2011 these trends have slowed considerably, showing signs of browning in many regions. It is unclear what factors are driving this change and which regions/landforms will be most sensitive to future browning. Here we provide evidence linking decadal patterns in arctic greening and browning with regional climate change and local permafrost-driven landscape heterogeneity. We analyzed the spatial variability of decadal-scale trends in surface greenness across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska (\textasciitilde 60,000\,km{$^2$}) using the Landsat archive (1999\textendash 2014), in combination with novel 30\,m classifications of polygonal tundra and regional watersheds, finding landscape heterogeneity and regional climate change to be the most important factors controlling historical greenness trends. Browning was linked to increased temperature and precipitation, with the exception of young landforms (developed following lake drainage), which will likely continue to green. Spatiotemporal model forecasting suggests carbon uptake potential to be reduced in response to warmer and/or wetter climatic conditions, potentially increasing the net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, at a greater degree than previously expected.},

We examined how parents could mitigate these negative weather effects by adjusting three behaviours\textemdash nest attendance, prey deliveries, and nest maintenance\textemdash before, during, and after storms at 11 nests of the at-risk Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo regalis) in Canada. Female adults spent an increasing amount of time on the nest as wind speed increased. Similar numbers of prey were delivered before and after storms, suggesting that Ferruginous Hawks do not compensate for lost foraging time. They appeared to demonstrate an ability to detect approaching storms, possibly by responding to falling barometric pressure cues, and may have mitigated the risk of nest damage by increasing their nest maintenance behaviours. Our study is among the first to observe storm preparation behaviour, and indicates that some raptorial birds have the ability to alter nesting behaviour in response to approaching inclement weather.},

We documented a link between water availability, predation risk, and reproductive success in a goose species (Chen caerulescens atlantica) inhabiting an Arctic environment where water is not considered a limited commodity. To reach water sources during incubation recesses, geese nesting in mesic tundra (low water availability) must move almost four times as far from their nest than those nesting in wetlands, which reduced their ability to defend their nest against predators and led to a higher predation rate. Nesting success was improved in high rainfall years due to increased water availability, and more so for geese nesting in the low water availability habitat. Likewise, nesting success was improved in years where the potential for evaporative water loss (measured by the atmospheric water vapor pressure) was low, presumably because females had to leave their nest less often to drink. Females from water-supplemented nests traveled a shorter distance to drink, and their nesting success was enhanced by 20\% compared to the control. This shows that water availability and rainfall can have a strong effect on predator\textendash prey dynamics and that changes in precipitation brought by climate change could have an impact on some Arctic species through a top-down effect.},

We wanted to determine rate of pellet-group decay and minimum count interval necessary to detect {$>$}90\% of overwinter pellet groups in coastal rain forests on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. We analyzed effects of elevation and aspect in a randomized block experimental design, with forest canopy effects examined as a split-plot effect. Decomposition of experimental pellet groups was rated periodically on an ordinal scale from December 1991 through May 1993. Pellet groups persisted longer overwinter than expected from other studies, indicating that pellet-group counts can be a reliable technique in many situations. At least 90\% of pellet groups were present after the first winter or 4 months after deposition. The detection rate of pellet groups on forested slopes was {$>$}90\% up to 1 year after deposition. Pellet groups in valley bottoms decayed more rapidly (P = 0.001) than those on mid- and upper slopes. Decomposition rates on north and south aspects were not different (P {$<$} 0.43). Pellet groups decayed more rapidly in clear-cuts than in forests (P {$<$} 0.001), which was opposite the pattern found in an earlier study. Decomposition rates and detection probabilities that we estimated are conservative and should be generally applicable for designing pellet-count studies in coastal forests of the Pacific Northwest with similar environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {While intra-population variability in resource use is ubiquitous, little is known of how this measure of niche diversity varies in space and its role in population dynamics. Here we examined how heterogeneous breeding environments can structure intra-population niche variation in both resource use and reproductive output. We investigated intra-population niche variation in the Arctic tundra ecosystem, studying peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus tundrius, White) breeding within a terrestrial-marine gradient near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada. Using stable isotope analysis, we found that intra-population niches varied at the individual level; we examined within-nest and among-nest variation, though only the latter varied along the terrestrial-marine gradient (i.e., increased among-nest variability among birds nesting within the marine environment, indicating higher degree of specialization). Terrestrial prey species (small herbivores and insectivores) were consumed by virtually all falcons. Falcons nesting within the marine environment made use of marine prey (sea birds), but depended heavily on terrestrial prey (up to 90\% of the diet). Using 28-years of peregrine falcon nesting data, we found a positive relationship between the proportion of terrestrial habitat surrounding nest sites and annual nestling production, but no relationship with the likelihood of successfully rearing at least one nestling reaching 25 days old. Annually, successful inland breeders raised 0.47 more young on average compared to offshore breeders, which yields potential fitness consequences for this long-living species. The analyses of niche and reproductive success suggest a potential breeding cost for accessing distant terrestrial prey, perhaps due to additional traveling costs, for those individuals with marine nest site locations. Our study indicates how landscape heterogeneity can generate proximate (niche variation) and ultimate (reproduction) consequences on a population of generalist predator. We also show that within-individual and among-individual variation are not mutually exclusive, but can simultaneously arise and structure intra-population niche variation.},

Designing a reliable index of chick body condition for a given species from a single measurement point requires knowledge about the extent of variation in body size, about chick age and about the relative sensitivity of the growth of different biometric measures to variation in environmental conditions. To gain this knowledge, we describe sex-specific variation in growth of several morphometric measures and body mass of Eurasian Spoonbills Platalea leucorodia. We repeatedly measured 35 chicks that grew up in small colonies on the island of Schiermonnikoog to derive detailed growth curves until fledging (based on the 12 surviving chicks) and to assess the extent of reduction in growth of starved chicks measured at least twice (n = 11) compared to those that survived. Growth curves until fledging were compared with biometric measurements of two to five week old chicks from (mostly) larger colonies of which hatching date was accurately estimated (n = 631). Growth of all measures, except the eighth primary, was sex-specific, with the most pronounced sex effect on the asymptotic values of tarsus length and body mass: adult males were predicted to become 17\% heavier than females and to have 22\% longer tarsi than females. Body mass and tarsus growth tended to be more reduced under food deprivation than (head-)bill and eighth primary growth. As an index of chick body condition, we propose to use the proportional deviation in body mass from the predicted body mass for a given age and sex. To do so, measurements of nearly fledged Spoonbill chicks should include at least eighth primary length to estimate age, tarsus length to estimate sex, and body mass as a measure that integrates age, sex and environmental effects.},

  abstract = {Independent species fluctuations are commonly used as a null hypothesis to test the role of competition and niche differences between species in community stability. This hypothesis, however, is unrealistic because it ignores the forces that contribute to synchronization of population dynamics. Here we present a mechanistic neutral model that describes the dynamics of a community of equivalent species under the joint influence of density dependence, environmental forcing, and demographic stochasticity. We also introduce a new standardized measure of species synchrony in multispecies communities. We show that the per capita population growth rates of equivalent species are strongly synchronized, especially when endogenous population dynamics are cyclic or chaotic, while their long-term fluctuations in population sizes are desynchronized by ecological drift. We then generalize our model to nonneutral dynamics by incorporating temporal and nontemporal forms of niche differentiation. Niche differentiation consistently decreases the synchrony of species per capita population growth rates, while its effects on the synchrony of population sizes are more complex. Comparing the observed synchrony of species per capita population growth rates with that predicted by the neutral model potentially provides a simple test of deterministic asynchrony in a community.},

  abstract = {In black grouse Tetrao tetrix the survival of juveniles from hatching until recruitment is a critical determinant of population growth. The proportion of juvenile survivors from hatching until recruitment declines continually, but juvenile mortality rates are commonly highest during approximately the first 10 days after hatching. Likely causes of mortality include adverse weather, predation and availability of food. Little is known, however, about how individual properties, such as body mass of hen or chicks and properties of the brood rearing environment (e.g. vegetation characteristics or weather conditions) interact with each other and/or with fluctuating levels of predator abundance in determining early brood survival, simply because such data are very scarce. Using an information-theoretic approach, our paper identifies determinants of early daily survival rates of black grouse chicks in a managed forest landscape of central Finland. During the three years of our study, the proportion of hens losing their broods within 10 days after hatching varied between 0.08 and 0.36.The variation in daily survival rates of chicks was largely mediated by a combination of four key explanatory variables. Brood survival clearly increased with the extent of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus cover, and was further affected by interactions of temperature and hatching date as well as temperature and chick body mass. Low temperatures consistently resulted in lower daily survival rates. An increase in temperature, however, was more beneficial for early hatchers and heavy chicks. There was no difference in survival between broods from yearling and adult hens and we found no effect of predator density, be it as main effect or as interaction with other variables, on the daily survival rates of chicks. Improving black grouse breeding success can be regarded as a key management target which may be critical for their recovery. Our results suggest that such management should favour protection or local recovery of bilberry, as well as integrate weather and climate changes into the equation of hunting management.},

  abstract = {The Arctic has undergone dramatic change during the past decade. The observed changes include atmospheric sea-level pressure, wind fields, sea-ice drift, ice cover, length of melt season, change in precipitation patterns, change in hydrology and change in ocean currents and watermass distribution. It is likely that these primary changes have altered the carbon cycle and biological systems, but the difficulty of observing these together with sporadic, incomplete time series makes it difficult to evaluate what the changes have been. Because contaminants enter global systems and transport through air and water, the changes listed above will clearly alter contaminant pathways. Here, we review what is known about recent changes using the Arctic Oscillation as a proxy to help us understand the forms under which global change will be manifest in the Arctic. For Pb, Cd and Zn, the Arctic is likely to become a more effective trap because precipitation is likely to increase. In the case of Cd, the natural cycle in the ocean appears to have a much greater potential to alter exposure than do human releases of this metal. Mercury has an especially complex cycle in the Arctic including a unique scavenging process (mercury depletion events), biomagnifying foodwebs, and chemical transformations such as methylation. The observation that mercury seems to be increasing in a number of aquatic species whereas atmospheric gaseous mercury shows little sign of change suggests that factors related to change in the physical system (ice cover, permafrost degradation, organic carbon cycling) may be more important than human activities.},

Failing to allow for the possibility that a target species was present, but undetected, at a site will lead to biased estimates of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark\textendash recapture studies. Via simulation, we show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in northern California and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Minnesota, USA.},

These biologist-driven extensions are characterized by ambiguity in both species presence and correct state classification, caused by imperfect detection. We first show the relationships between independently published approaches to the modeling of multistate occupancy. We then extend the pattern-based modeling to the case of sampling over multiple seasons or years in order to estimate state transition probabilities associated with system dynamics. The methodology and its potential for addressing relevant ecological questions are demonstrated using both maximum likelihood (occupancy and successful reproduction dynamics of California Spotted Owl) and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation approaches (changes in relative abundance of green frogs in Maryland). Just as multistate capture\textendash recapture modeling has revolutionized the study of individual marked animals, we believe that multistate occupancy modeling will dramatically increase our ability to address interesting questions about ecological processes underlying population-level dynamics.},

Managed honeybees are particularly used within mass-flowering crops and often spill over to adjacent natural habitats after crop blooming. Here, we uniquely show the simultaneous impact that honeybee spillover has on wild plant and animal communities in flower-rich woodlands via changes in plant-pollinator network structure that translate into a direct negative effect on the reproductive success of a dominant wild plant. Honeybee spillover leads to a re-assembly of plant-pollinator interactions through increased competition with other pollinator species. Moreover, honeybee preference for the most abundant plant species reduces its seed set, driven by high honeybee visitation rates that prevent pollen tube growth. Our study therefore calls for an adequate understanding of the trade-offs between providing pollination services to crops and the effects that managed pollinators might have on wild plants and pollinators.},

Collectively, hatching success, Xedging success, and productivity (chicks Xedged per egg laid) were similar between our study and results from colonies located south of the Arctic. However, a larger proportion of fulmars at apparently occupied sites (AOS) in high Arctic colonies appeared to forego egg-laying, resulting in lower proportions of chicks Xedged per AOS. Extreme inclement weather was the major factor inXuencing nesting success, resulting in pulses of egg or chick loss during or immediately following major storms, although the mechanism of eVects appeared to diVer between the two colonies.

  abstract = {Predator Avoidance Strategy Selective pressures influencing bird migration can include availability of food, pressure from parasites and pathogens, and predation risk. The importance of the last of these is revealed by McKinnon et al. (p. 326; see the Perspective by Gilg and Yoccoz), who present an experimental analysis of the benefits of long-distance migration for reproduction in arctic-nesting birds. Measurements of a controlled effect of predation risk along a 3350-kilometer north-south gradient across arctic Canada provides evidence that the risk of nest predation decreases with latitude. Thus, birds migrating further north may acquire reproductive benefits in the form of reduced predation risk. Quantifying the costs and benefits of migration distance is critical to understanding the evolution of long-distance migration. In migratory birds, life history theory predicts that the potential survival costs of migrating longer distances should be balanced by benefits to lifetime reproductive success, yet quantification of these reproductive benefits in a controlled manner along a large geographical gradient is challenging. We measured a controlled effect of predation risk along a 3350-kilometer south-north gradient in the Arctic and found that nest predation risk declined more than twofold along the latitudinal gradient. These results provide evidence that birds migrating farther north may acquire reproductive benefits in the form of lower nest predation risk. Egg predation rates measured at artificial nests along a 3000-kilometer transect decrease northwards. Egg predation rates measured at artificial nests along a 3000-kilometer transect decrease northwards.},

  abstract = {Successful management of wildlife populations requires accurate estimates of abundance. Abundance estimates can be confounded by imperfect detection during wildlife surveys. N-mixture models enable quantification of detection probability and, under appropriate conditions, produce abundance estimates that are less biased. Here, we demonstrate use of the R-INLA package for R to analyze N-mixture models and compare performance of R-INLA to two other common approaches: JAGS (via the runjags package for R), which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo and allows Bayesian inference, and the unmarked package for R, which uses maximum likelihood and allows frequentist inference. We show that R-INLA is an attractive option for analyzing N-mixture models when (i) fast computing times are necessary (R-INLA is 10 times faster than unmarked and 500 times faster than JAGS), (ii) familiar model syntax and data format (relative to other R packages) is desired, (iii) survey-level covariates of detection are not essential, and (iv) Bayesian inference is preferred.},

Hatching asynchrony (HA), which occurs whenever incubation commences before clutch completion, may comprise such a tactic. For instance, the sibling rivalry hypothesis states that the hierarchy among chicks, concomitant to HA, should both facilitate the adjustment of brood size to environmental conditions and reduce several components of sibling competition as compared to synchronous hatching, at both brood and individual levels. We thus predicted that brood aggression, begging and feeding rates should decrease and that older chick superiority should increase with HA increasing, leading to higher growth and survival rates. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of an experimental upward and downward manipulation of HA magnitude on behaviour, growth and survival of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) chicks.},

Such models can be used to investigate the relationships between distribution and environmental covariates as well as reliably estimate abundances and create maps of animal/plant distribution. Density surface models consist of a spatial model of the abundance of a biological population which has been corrected for uncertain detection via distance sampling methods. We review recent developments in the field and consider the likely directions of future research before focussing on a popular approach based on generalized additive models. In particular, we consider spatial modelling techniques that may be advantageous to applied ecologists such as quantification of uncertainty in a two-stage model and smoothing in areas with complex boundaries.

  abstract = {Abstract: Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) undergo remarkable cycles and are the primary prey base of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), a carnivore recently listed as threatened in the contiguous United States. Efforts to evaluate hare densities using pellets have traditionally been based on regression equations developed in the Yukon, Canada. In western Montana, we evaluated whether or not local regression equations performed better than the most recent Yukon equation and assessed whether there was concordance between pellet-based predictions and mark-recapture density estimates of hares. We developed local Montana regression equations based on 224 data points consisting of mark-recapture estimates and pellet counts, derived from 38 sites in 2 different areas sampled for 1 to 5 years using 2 different pellet plot shapes. We evaluated concordance between estimated density and predicted density based on pellet counts coupled with regression equations at 436 site-area-season combinations different from those used to develop the regression equations. At densities below 0.3 hares/ha, predicted density based on pellets tended to be greater than for mark-recapture; the difference was usually {$<$}1 hare per ha on an absolute scale, but at low densities this translated to proportional differences of 1,000\% or greater. At densities above 0.7 hares/ha, pellet regressions tended to predict lower density than mark-recapture. Because local regression equations did not outperform the Yukon equation, we see little merit in further development of local regression equations unless a study is to be conducted in a formal double-sampling framework. We recommend that widespread pellet sampling be used to identify areas with very low hare densities; subsequent surveys using mark-recapture methodology can then focus on higher density areas where density inferences are more reliable.},

  abstract = {1. A quantitative parasitoid web was constructed describing the trophic relationships between the community of aphids, parasitoids and secondary parasitoids in an abandoned field in southern England. Root aphids were omitted and secondary parasitoids were associated with aphids rather than primary parasitoids. All aphids, parasitoids and trophic links were expressed in the same units (m-2). Over a 2-year period, separate webs were constructed for every month that aphids and parasitoids were active in the field. 2. Twenty-six species of plants were attacked by 25 species of aphid which were parasitized by 18 species of primary parasitoids. The primary parasitoids were attacked by 28 species of secondary parasitoids, of which 18 directly attacked the still living aphid (hyperparasitoids) and 10 attacked the aphid after mummification (mummy parasitoids). The aphids were attended by three species of ants. 3. Eleven webs were constructed for the months May to September 1994 and May to October 1995. Aphids and primary parasitoids were most abundant and diverse in June, and secondary parasitoids one month later. 4. The ratios of the number of aphid species to the number of species of primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were relatively constant across webs, as was the ratio of the number of links involving hyperparasitoids and mummy parasitoids. The ratio of the total number of links to the total number of species increased with web size. 5. The relative abundance of the species in the different webs was well described by a Dirichlet distribution with a common parameter. This implies a gamma distribution of aphid abundances in the field with few common and many rare species. 6. Predator (i.e. parasitoid) overlap graphs were constructed to assess the potential for indirect interactions between aphids. Mummy parasitoids were the most important group linking different aphids. A quantitative overlap diagram was developed to illustrate the potential strengths of indirect linkages. Common aphid species shared few strong, indirect links via primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but could be strongly linked by mummy parasitoids. Symmetrical links were uncommon, and rare species were potentially strongly influenced by the presence of common aphids with which they shared parasitoids. 7. Ant-attended aphids were attacked by fewer species of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids than those species not attended by ants. Species of mummy parasitoids attack, on average, approximately twice the number of host species than species of either primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids.},

  abstract = {The ``greening of the Arctic'' is among the world's most significant large scale ecological responses to global climate change1. The Arctic has warmed at twice the rate of the rest of the planet on average in recent decades2 and satellite-derived vegetation indices have indicated widespread increases in productivity (termed ``greening'') at high latitudes3\textendash 8. Greening trends have been attributed to in situ increases in vegetation biomass, cover and abundance9\textendash 11 associated with warming trends12. Satellite observations allow for the quantification of vegetation change across northern biomes that are otherwise unevenly sampled by in situ ecological observations13. Satellite-derived data thus broadly inform predictions of large-scale climate feedbacks involving plant biomass, carbon storage, and surface energy budget14,15. Recently however, remotely-sensed Arctic greening trends have shown periods of slowing or even reversing in some regions (termed ``Arctic browning'')16\textendash 19 sometimes arising from acute declines in productivity18,20\textendash 23 seemingly at odds with earlier responses to long-term warming trends24. Research now indicates substantial diversity in ecological responses to changing climate regimes in the Arctic25, but precise attribution of patterns and trends to ecological process remains a challenge due to conceptual and technical barriers in the analysis and combined interpretation of satellite and in situ observations3,20,26,27. An emerging consensus is that the underlying causes and future dynamics of Arctic greening and browning patterns and trends are complex, variable, and inherently scale dependent. Here, we review the complexities associated with observing and interpreting high-latitude greening to promote improved consensus, suggest a framework to focus future work, and identify these key research priorities that will advance applications of satellite and in situ observations to the study of past, present, and future Arctic vegetation change.},

Studies indicate that warming temperatures, changes in snow cover, altered disturbance regimes as a result of permafrost thaw, tundra fires, and anthropogenic activities or changes in herbivory intensity are all contributing to observed changes in shrub abundance. A large-scale increase in shrub cover will change the structure of tundra ecosystems and alter energy fluxes, regional climate, soil\textendash atmosphere exchange of water, carbon and nutrients, and ecological interactions between species. In order to project future rates of shrub expansion and understand the feedbacks to ecosystem and climate processes, future research should investigate the species or trait-specific responses of shrubs to climate change including: (1) the temperature sensitivity of shrub growth, (2) factors controlling the recruitment of new individuals, and (3) the relative influence of the positive and negative feedbacks involved in shrub expansion.},

  abstract = {Shrubs have increased in abundance and dominance in arctic and alpine regions in recent decades. This often dramatic change, likely due to climate warming, has the potential to alter both the structure and function of tundra ecosystems. The analysis of shrub growth is improving our understanding of tundra vegetation dynamics and environmental changes. However, dendrochronological methods developed for trees, need to be adapted for the morphology and growth eccentricity of shrubs. Here, we review current and developing methods to measure radial and axial growth, estimate age, and assess growth dynamics in relation to environmental variables. Recent advances in sampling methods, analysis and applications have improved our ability to investigate growth and recruitment dynamics of shrubs. However, to extrapolate findings to the biome scale, future dendroecological work will require improved approaches that better address variation in growth within parts of the plant, among individuals within populations and between species.},

This `greening of the Arctic' is among the world's most important large-scale ecological responses to global climate change. However, a consensus is emerging that the underlying causes and future dynamics of so-called Arctic greening and browning trends are more complex, variable and inherently scale-dependent than previously thought. Here we summarize the complexities of observing and interpreting high-latitude greening to identify priorities for future research. Incorporating satellite and proximal remote sensing with in-situ data, while accounting for uncertainties and scale issues, will advance the study of past, present and future Arctic vegetation change.},

  abstract = {Arctic plant communities are altered by climate changes. The magnitude of these alterations depends on whether species distributions are determined by macroclimatic conditions, by factors related to local topography, or by biotic interactions. Our current understanding of the relative importance of these conditions is limited due to the scarcity of studies, especially in the High Arctic. We investigated variations in vascular plant community composition and species richness based on 288 plots distributed on three sites along a coast-inland gradient in Northeast Greenland using a stratified random design. We used an information theoretic approach to determine whether variations in species richness were best explained by macroclimate, by factors related to local topography (including soil water) or by plant-plant interactions. Latent variable models were used to explain patterns in plant community composition. Species richness was mainly determined by variations in soil water content, which explained 35\% of the variation, and to a minor degree by other variables related to topography. Species richness was not directly related to macroclimate. Latent variable models showed that 23.0\% of the variation in community composition was explained by variables related to topography, while distance to the inland ice explained an additional 6.4 \%. This indicates that some species are associated with environmental conditions found in only some parts of the coast\textendash inland gradient. Inclusion of macroclimatic variation increased the model's explanatory power by 4.2\%. Our results suggest that the main impact of climate changes in the High Arctic will be mediated by their influence on local soil water conditions. Increasing temperatures are likely to cause higher evaporation rates and alter the distribution of late-melting snow patches. This will have little impact on landscape-scale diversity if plants are able to redistribute locally to remain in areas with sufficient soil water.},

According to co ntemporary sources grey birds were part of the local breeding popul ation (islandus-type birds) but the other morph s represented mainly visitors from Greenland . This is also the current situation but some of the lightest Icelandic breeders co uld be class ified as half-white. The rock ptarmigan harvest data concerned birds exported to Europe in the period 1864-1 919, in total ca 3.3 million birds . The data series for white and half-white gyrfalcons were significa ntly corre lated (r = 0.50 I, P {$<$} 0.00 1). The data series for grey and white morp hs (r = -0.099, P = 0.445 ) and grey and the half-white morphs (r = -0.1183, P = 0.360), showed no corre latio n. Time series analysis showed that the white (candicans-type) morph fluctuated irregu larly. The half-white morph behaved similarly but also showe d some affinity with the grey morph, and could have represented a mixt ure of local breeders and Greenland ic winter visitors. Grey morph gyrf alco ns and rock ptarm igan showed regular fluctuations in numbers with a 10-year period icity. The reliance of Iceland ic gyrfalcons on rock ptarmigan during the early part of the breedin g seaso n and in all phases of the ptarmigan cycle is well esta blished and may offer a case for causal connections between the two cyclic populations.},

The addition of nectar did not influence pollinator visitation rates, unless the pollinators were choosing only among flowers with red disks.

Here, to forecast future trends in species occurrences and richness, we fitted species\textendash environment models with temperature data from three climate scenarios and simulated up to a 40\% decrease in snow cover duration (SCD)3. We used plot-scale data on 273 vascular plant, moss and lichen species in 1,200 study sites spanning a wide range of environmental conditions typical for mountainous Arctic landscapes (within 165\,km2). According to the models, a rise in temperature increased overall species richness and caused only one species to lose all suitable habitat. In contrast, a shorter SCD tempered the effect of increasing temperature on species richness and led to accelerated rates of species' local extinctions after a tipping point at 20\textendash 30\% SCD decrease. All three species groups showed similar extinction rates but contrasting species richness responses. Our simulations indicate that future biodiversity patterns in Arctic regions are highly dependent on the evolution of snow conditions. Climate impact models that ignore the effects of snow cover change may provide biased biodiversity projections, with potentially erratic implications for Arctic nature conservation planning.},

It interprets landscape ecological principles, with focus on population dynamics, to specific information required to support a particular decision at each stage of the process. The approach focuses on deciduous woodland with the redstart Phoenicurous phoenicurous as an umbrella species for woodland birds and is illustrated within the fragmented landscape of the east midlands area of England. The method requires the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to estimate the connectivity of habitat patches. Each patch is assigned a ``cost'' value that represents the cost of dispersal over a friction surface. The sites are ranked accordingly and, in combination with the spatial context and size, are prioritised in terms of their potential for forming cores for habitat creation. Habitat patches with low cost values, a large area of surrounding habitat and small size were identified as potential sites for expansion in order to satisfy the minimum requirements of the species. The approach is generic, applicable to any species, and despite its limitations it can be a useful aid in conservation planning. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Adverse weather conditions during parental care may have direct consequences for offspring production, but longer-term effects on juvenile and parental survival are less well known. We used long-term data on reproductive output, recruitment, and parental survival in northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) to investigate the effects of rainfall during parental care on fledging success, recruitment success (juvenile survival), and parental survival, and how these effects related to nestling age, breeding time, habitat quality, and parental nest visitation rates. While accounting for effects of temperature, fledging success was negatively related to rainfall (days {$>$} 10 mm) in the second half of the nestling period, with the magnitude of this effect being greater for breeding attempts early in the season. Recruitment success was, however, more sensitive to the number of rain days in the first half of the nestling period. Rainfall effects on parental survival differed between the sexes; males were more sensitive to rain during the nestling period than females. We demonstrate a probable mechanism driving the rainfall effects on reproductive output: Parental nest visitation rates decline with increasing amounts of daily rainfall, with this effect becoming stronger after consecutive rain days. Our study shows that rain during the nestling stage not only relates to fledging success but also has longerterm effects on recruitment and subsequent parental survival. Thus, if we want to understand or predict population responses to future climate change, we need to consider the potential impacts of changing rainfall patterns in addition to temperature, and how these will affect target species' vital rates.},

Yet, understanding network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an arctic pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links per species.},

  abstract = {Recent Pan-Arctic shrub expansion has been interpreted as a response to a warmer climate. However, herbivores can also influence the abundance of shrubs in arctic ecosystems. We addressed these alternative explanations by following the changes in plant community composition during the last 10 years in permanent plots inside and outside exclosures with different mesh sizes that exclude either only reindeer or all mammalian herbivores including voles and lemmings. The exclosures were replicated at three forest and tundra sites at four different locations along a climatic gradient (oceanic to continental) in northern Fennoscandia. Since the last 10 years have been exceptionally warm, we could study how warming has influenced the vegetation in different grazing treatments. Our results show that the abundance of the dominant shrub, Betula nana, has increased during the last decade, but that the increase was more pronounced when herbivores were excluded. Reindeer have the largest effect on shrubs in tundra, while voles and lemmings have a larger effect in the forest. The positive relationship between annual mean temperature and shrub growth in the absence of herbivores and the lack of relationships in grazed controls is another indication that shrub abundance is controlled by an interaction between herbivores and climate. In addition to their effects on taller shrubs (40.3 m), reindeer reduced the abundance of lichens, whereas microtine rodents reduced the abundance of dwarf shrubs (o0.3 m) and mosses. In contrast to short-term responses, competitive interactions between dwarf shrubs and lichens were evident in the long term. These results show that herbivores have to be considered in order to understand how a changing climate will influence tundra ecosystems.},

We analyzed the effects of climate on the survival and recruitment of both sexes and several age classes of a long-lived tropical seabird, the Blue-footed Booby (Sula nebouxii ), using longterm observations on marked individuals. Results demonstrated a complex interaction between yearly fluctuations in climate (both local and global indexes, during both winter and breeding season) and the sex and age of individuals. Youngest birds' survival and recruitment were commonly affected by local climate, whereas oldest birds' parameters tended to be constant and less influenced by environmental variables. These results confirm the theoretical prediction that sex- and age-related variation in life-history demographic traits is greater under poor environmental conditions, and they highlight the importance of including variability in fitness components in demographic and evolutionary models. Males and females showed similar variation in survival but different recruitment patterns, in relation to both age and the spatial scale of climatic influence (local or global). Results indicate different lifehistory tactics for each sex and different ages, with birds likely trying to maximize their fitness by responding to the environmental contingencies of each year.},

However, determining the effects of environmental covariates on dispersal from spatial-temporal abundance proxy data is challenging owing to the complexity of model specification for directional dispersal permeability and the extremely high computational loads for numerical integration. In this paper, we present a case study estimating how environmental covariates affect the dispersal of Japanese sika deer by developing a spatially explicit state-space matrix model coupled with an improved numerical integration technique (Markov chain Monte Carlo with particle filters). In particular, we explored the environmental drivers of inhomogeneous range expansion, characteristic of animals with short dispersal. Our model framework successfully reproduced the complex population dynamics of sika deer, including rapid changes in densely populated areas and distribution fronts within a decade. Furthermore, our results revealed that the inhomogeneous range expansion of sika deer seemed to be primarily caused by the dispersal process (i.e., movement barriers in fragmented forests) rather than population growth. Our state-space matrix model enables the inference of population dynamics for a broad range of organisms, even those with low dispersal ability, in heterogeneous landscapes, and could address many pressing issues in conservation biology and ecosystem management.},

  abstract = {Part of the attraction of ecology and its related intellectual challenges is its dynamic complexity. Darwin's (1) entangled bank metaphor captured the essence; it wasn't just that everything was connected to everything else but rather that specific relationships mattered. Darwin found that mowed turf contained approximately twice as many species as unmowed turf; a logical chain of influence was argued to link the probability of clover pollination and seed production to the negative influence of domestic cats on mice, themselves major predators of bumble bees doing the pollinating. Since Darwin's time an ever-increasing array of field experiments and observations has substantiated the dynamic consequences of these connections, especially in aquatic systems (2\textendash 6). These and many comparable examples share the common feature of highlighting the importance of apex predators and therefore top-down trophic control of population dynamics and community structure. In many cases, chains of indirect interactions among species with shared predators intensify top-down control. Effects are particularly acute when these relationships are asymmetric; one species may be a significant energy source for a predator without being regulated by it, thus strengthening the predatory impacts on other prey (7). Change is commonplace in ecosystems with awareness heightened by the consequences of introductions of exotic or nonnative species or range expansions of those native to the system. The research contribution by Roemer et al. in this issue of PNAS (8) adds a novel dimension to the complexity of responses to biological invasions. The presence of feral, nonnative pigs seems to have enabled golden eagles to colonize some of California's Channel Islands, resulting in restructuring of an island food web and the approaching extinction of an endangered native fox. A hypothesis is proposed that native spotted skunks compete with foxes; piglets bolster eagle \ldots},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which climate change will affect animal populations is vital for adaptive management. Many studies have described changes in the timing of biological events, which can produce phenological mismatch. Direct effects on prey abundance might also be important, but have rarely been studied. We examine the likely importance of variation in prey abundance in driving the demographics of a European golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) population at its southern range margin. Previous studies have correlated plover productivity with the abundance of their adult cranefly (Tipulidae) prey, and modelled the phenology of both plover breeding and cranefly emergence in relation to temperature. Our analyses demonstrate that abundance of adult craneflies is correlated with August temperature in the previous year. Correspondingly, changes in the golden plover population are negatively correlated with August temperature 2 years earlier. Predictions of annual productivity, based on temperature-mediated reductions in prey abundance, closely match observed trends. Modelled variation in annual productivity for a future scenario of increasing August temperatures predicts a significant risk of extinction of the golden plover population over the next 100 years, depending upon the magnitude of warming. Direct effects of climate warming upon cranefly populations may therefore cause northward range contractions of golden plovers, as predicted by climate envelope modelling. Craneflies are an important food source for many northern and upland birds, and our results are likely to have wide relevance to these other species. Research into the potential for habitat management to improve the resilience of cranefly populations to high temperature should be an urgent priority.},

Yet, these are primarily investigated by assessing abundance fluctuations of a few dominant species, which inadequately reflect ecosystem-wide changes. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that it is not species identity per se, but their traits that determine environmental responses, biological interactions and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated long-term, spatio-temporal variability in trait composition across multiple organism groups to assess whether functional changes occur in a similar way across trophic levels and whether shifts in trait composition link to environmental change. We combined extensive trait datasets with long-term surveys (30\textendash 40 yr) of four organism groups (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish) in three environmentally distinct areas of a large marine ecosystem. We found similar temporal trajectories in the community weighted mean trait time-series of the different trophic groups, revealing ecosystem-wide functional changes. The traits involved and their dynamics differed between areas, concurrent with climate-driven changes in temperature and salinity, as well as more local dynamics in nutrients and oxygen. This finding highlights the importance of considering both global climate, as well as local external drivers when studying ecosystem changes. Using a multi-trophic trait-based approach, our study demonstrates the importance of integrating community functional dynamics across multiple trophic levels to capture ecosystem-wide responses which could, ultimately, help moving towards a holistic understanding, assessment and management of marine ecosystems.},

Arctic-nesting passerines provide a good model system in which to explore variation within and between species in growth rates with regard to environmental conditions and the timing of clutch initiation.

The nestling period of 2014 was both colder (with lower minimum and maximum temperatures) and wetter (with 73\% more rainfall) than 2013. Arthropod biomass was also reduced in shrub tundra in 2014 compared to 2013. Both species showed reductions in rate of daily mass gain of nestlings in 2014 compared to 2013, but we observed no significant difference between species. Furthermore, we found that in 2014 early nesting birds had higher rates of nestling growth than those initiating clutches later in the season. These findings suggest that overall environmental conditions were more challenging for raising nestlings in 2014 compared to 2013 and that these differences were manifested in a reduced rate of nestling mass gain in both species. Furthermore, both species showed a negative correlation between precipitation and growth rates, whereas only Lapland Longspur showed a positive correlation between growth rates and temperature.},

This habitat degradation has been shown to induce a trophic cascade that negatively affects plant, insect, and other avian species that share these habitats. In conjunction with a long-term study of the impacts of Lesser Snow Geese on habitat, we examined the dual influences of climate and long-term habitat change on the nesting occurrence of Savannah Sparrows near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Using multistate occupancy models, we found that variability in early-summer temperature and precipitation modulated year-to-year variability in nesting occurrence and detection probabilities. Extreme warm and wet conditions in early summer can benefit breeding Savannah Sparrows across the landscape. However, such events have not been prevalent enough to override the \textasciitilde 80\% decline in Savannah Sparrow nesting occurrence over 36 yr. This dramatic decline can be attributed to the legacy of Lesser Snow Goose foraging, which has led to an 84\% reduction in preferred shrub habitat for nesting Savannah Sparrows. Management actions targeted at reducing Lesser Snow Goose abundance and habitat restoration will be needed to allow sympatric Savannah Sparrows and functionally similar species to recover.},

  abstract = {The animal soundscape is a field of growing interest because of the implications it has for human\textendash landscape interactions. Yet, it continues to be a difficult subject to investigate, due to the huge amount of information which it contains. In this contribution, the suitability of the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) is examined. It is an algorithm created to produce a direct quantification of the complex biotic songs by computing the variability of the intensities registered in audio-recordings, despite the presence of constant human-generated-noise. Twenty audio-recordings were made at equally spaced locations in a beech mountain forest in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennine National Park (Italy) between June and July 2008. The study area is characterized by the absence of recent human disturbance to forest assets but the presence of airplane routes does bring engine noise that overlaps and mixes with the natural soundscape, which resulted entirely composed by bird songs. The intensity values and frequency bin occurrences of soundscapes, the total number of bird vocalizations and the ACI were processed by using the Songscope v2.1 and Avisoft v4.40 software. The Spearman's rho calculation highlighted a significant correlation between the ACI values and the number of bird vocalizations, while the frequency bin occurrence and acoustic intensity were weaker correlated to bird singing activity because of the inclusion of all of the other geo/anthro-phonies composing the soundscape. The ACI tends to be efficient in filtering out anthrophonies (such as airplane engine noise), and demonstrates the capacity to synthetically and efficiently describe the complexity of bird soundscapes. Finally, this index offers new opportunities for the monitoring of songbird communities faced with the challenge of human-induced disturbances and other proxies like climate and land use changes.},

  abstract = {Dynamic population models typically aim to predict demography and the resulting population dynamics in relation to environmental variation. However, they rarely include the diversity of individual responses to environmental changes, thus hampering our understanding of demographic mechanisms. We develop an integrated integral projection model (IPM2) that is a combination of an integrated population model (IPMpop) and an integral projection model (IPMind). IPM2 includes interactions between environmental and individual effects on demographic rates and can forecast both population size and individual trait distributions. First, we study the performance of this model using eight simulated scenarios with variable reproductive selective pressures on an individual trait. When the individual trait interacts with the environmental variable and the selective pressure on the individual trait is non-linear, only IPM2 produces adequate predictions, because IPMind does not link predictions between the population level and observed data and because IPMpop does not include the individual trait. Second, we apply IPM2 to a population of barn swallows. The model accurately predicts trends of the barn swallow population while also providing mechanistic insights. High precipitation negatively influenced population dynamics through delaying laying dates, which lowered reproductive and survival rates. To predict the future of populations, we need to understand their individual drivers and thus include individual responses to their environment while following the entire population. As a consequence, IPM2 will improve our ability to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses and improve the accuracy of population forecasting to aid management programs.},

  abstract = {The wild boar is a native animal species of the Czech Republic that has significantly increased its population density in recent years. Objective methods of population density estimation are required to inform the intensity of regulation needed for the sustainable management of the wild boar. Population estimation and regulation of the abundance of the wild boar are problematic in comparison to those of other ungulates, and the only widely used method of control is intensive hunting. The purpose of this study was to test if faecal pellet group (FPG) counting was a reliable method of wild boar population censusing in a forest environment. The density of wild boars was evaluated in an area of 22.56 km2, circumscribed by both natural and man-made barriers that restrict wild boar migration. As it is essential for proper application of FPG count methods, a separate trial was carried out to determine the daily defecation rate of wild boars. The distribution of faeces in different types of habitat in a forest environment was tested. As the period of faeces accumulation fell within the intensive hunting season, the result is biased by the fact that the calculation includes FPGs produced by animals removed from the population through hunting during winter. The average daily defecation rate of adults and piglets was 4.29 and 5.82, respectively. The corrected (without shot animals) average density of wild boars in the study area estimated by the FPG count at the time of the census was 6.08 individuals (ind.)/km2. We have confirmed that an FPG count conducted in winter is applicable for estimation of wild boar abundance on a forested area.},

A significant adverse relationship between the sum of rainfall in the laying period and the mean egg volume in a clutch was found. Greater mortality among young Eurasian Bitterns was also correlated with strong rains and winds during the chick-rearing period.

However, this assumption has not been investigated in an analytical framework that simultaneously examines acceleration of warming with latitude while accounting for variation in phenological time series characteristics that might also co-vary with latitude. We analyzed 743 phenological trend estimates spanning 86 years and 42.6 degrees of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as rates of Northern Hemisphere warming over the same period and latitudinal range. We detected significant patterns of co-variation in phenological time series characteristics that may confound estimates of the magnitude of variation in trends with latitude. Notably, shorter and more recent time series tended to produce the strongest phenological trends, and these also tended to be from higher latitude studies. However, accounting for such variation only slightly modified the relationship between rates of phenological advance and latitude, which was highly significant. Furthermore, warming has increased non-linearly with latitude over the past several decades, most strongly since 1998 and northward of 59\textdegree N latitude. The acceleration of warming with latitude has likely contributed to an acceleration of phenological advance along the same gradient.},

  abstract = {The field of machine learning is witnessing its golden era as deep learning slowly becomes the leader in this domain. Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models. Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing. However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective. The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level. Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth. This article presents a comprehensive review of historical and recent state-of-the-art approaches in visual, audio, and text processing; social network analysis; and natural language processing, followed by the in-depth analysis on pivoting and groundbreaking advances in deep learning applications. It was also undertaken to review the issues faced in deep learning such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning and to illustrate how these challenges can be transformed into prolific future research avenues.},

Chapters are well supported with charts, maps, schematic diagrams, and photographs. Current Ornithology is the only English-language publication currently devoted exclusively to extensive reviews and synthesis of topics pertaining to all aspects of the biology of birds. Chapters fall under such diverse rubrics as ecology, evolution, behavior, phylogeny, behavioral ecology, anatomy and physiology, and conservation biology. All authors are leading authorities on their subjects, and each chapter is refereed by experts in the topics covered. Although all chapters focus primarily on birds, some topics, such as the social cognition of birds as compared to primates (Volume 13), have significant application to disciplines outside of ornithology. Current Ornithology aims to provide an accessible, up-to-date, accurate source of data and to contribute to conceptual generalization and unification across the biological sciences.},

We tested four predictions of the generalist predator hypothesis as a possible explanation for relatively constant lemming densities: (1) predators do not show strong numerical responses to lemming density; (2) the proportion of lemming biomass in predator diets declines with declining lemming abundance, compensated for by increased consumption of alternative prey; (3) predators show a type-III functional response to lemming density; and (4) at low densities, predation on lemmings ceases.},

  abstract = {The reasons why growth and developmental rates vary widely among species have remained unclear. Previous examinations of possible environmental influences on growth rates of birds yielded few correlations, leading to suggestions that young may be growing at maximum rates allowed within physiological constraints. However, estimations of growth rates can be confounded by variation in relative developmental stage at fledging. Here, we reestimate growth rates to control for developmental stage. We used these data to examine the potential covariation of growth and development with environmental variation across a sample of 115 North American passerines. Contrary to previous results, we found that growth rates of altricial nestlings were strongly positively correlated to daily nest predation rates, even after controlling for adult body mass and phylogeny. In addition, nestlings of species under stronger predation pressure remained in the nest for a shorter period, and they left the nest at lower body mass relative to adult body mass. Thus, nestlings both grew faster and left the nest at an earlier developmental stage in species with higher risk of predation. Growth patterns were also related to food, clutch size, and latitude. These results support a view that growth and developmental rates of altricial nestlings are strongly influenced by the environmental conditions experienced by species, and they generally lend support to an adaptive view of interspecific variation in growth and developmental rates.},

To examine the adaptive basis of growth rates, models are formulatedwhich incorporatethe mortalityof the young, their energy requirementand their rate of growth into a functionwhich determinesthe productivityof offspring. This functionis maximized when growth rate occurs as rapidly as possible, at the expense of brood size. Optimally, one young should be raised which grows as rapidly as the parents are able to supply food. Because this is not observed in nature, and because of other inefficienciesdue to the form of the growth curve, it is postulated that physiological constraints,based on the functionalorganization of the body plan, limit growth rate. This may occur either through bottlenecks placed on the rate at which food can be processed and utilized, or by problems of allocation of energy and tissues among mature and embryonicfunctions.},

Two predictions of this hypothesis, (1) that species with broods of one (Bi) should grow more slowly than those with larger broods (B2+), and (2) that growth rates should be more variable among Bi species than among B2+ species, are confirmed. A simple numerical calculation illustrates that sibling competition may exert very strong selection on growth rate compared to that of extemal mortality factors, provided that growth rate accurately predicts the outcome of competition between sibs. The results of such selection depend on the evolutionary flexibility of growth rate in response to factors causing mortality of nestlings. Attempts to relate growth rate to total mortality rate of nestlings and to mortality within broods failed. Hence, I could find neither direct support for the sibling-competition growthrate hypothesis nor evidence for flexibility of growth rate with respect to nestling mortality. Three alternatives for slow growth among Bi species are discussed: (1) limitation by availability of food, (2) limitation by the availability of essential nutrients in the diet, and (3) increased precocity of the chicks of Bi species.

In the models, growth rate influences production through its effects on the power requirements of the nestling and the length of the nesting cycle; the latter in turn affects probability of survival to fledging and number of broods reared per year. The models were evaluated to determine whether empirically reasonable estimates of power requirements and nesting mortality resulted in predicted optimum growth rates within the range of observed values. By and large the models were successful. They do not adequately explain the reduced growth rates of tropical altricial species compared to their temperate-zone counterparts. Moreover, they do not address the phenomenon of slow growth in self-feeding, precocial species. But the confirmation of the model for many altricial birds suggests that it may be possible to understand interspecific variation in growth rates as the result of adaptations to levels of predation and the requirement for, and availability of, energy to the nestling.},

Growth of mass, head, wing and tarsus was followed and related to the treatment, weather conditions, hatching date and interactive effects. Food supply did not limit chick growth in the studied season. Parents seemed to try to feed their chicks at a maximum rate and succeeded in the studied season because the general food supply was very good. Low temperatures and strong winds depressed chick growth. A growth advantage of food-supplemented chicks could be observed when the natural conditions for chick growth were sub-optimal. Chick growth rate was strongly negatively associated with hatching date and worsening weather during the reproductive season could be excluded as explanatory variable for this finding.},

  abstract = {Climate change is occurring more rapidly in the Arctic than other places in the world, which is likely to alter the distribution and abundance of migratory birds breeding there. A warming climate can provide benefits to birds by decreasing spring snow cover, but increases in the frequency of summer rainstorms, another product of climate change, may reduce foraging opportunities for insectivorous birds. Cyclic lemming populations in the Arctic also influence bird abundance because Arctic foxes begin consuming bird eggs when lemmings decline. The complex interaction between summer temperature, precipitation, and the lemming cycle hinder our ability to predict how Arctic-breeding birds will respond to climate change. The main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between annual variation in weather, spring snow cover, lemming abundance and spatiotemporal variation in the abundance of multiple avian guilds in a tundra ecosystem in central Nunavut, Canada: songbirds, shorebirds, gulls, loons, and geese. We spatially stratified our study area based on vegetation productivity, terrain ruggedness, and freshwater abundance, and conducted distance sampling to estimate strata-specific densities of each guild during the summers of 2010\textendash 2012. We also monitored temperature, rainfall, spring snow cover, and lemming abundance each year. Spatial variation in bird abundance matched what was expected based on previous ecological knowledge, but weather and lemming abundance also significantly influenced the abundance of some guilds. In particular, songbirds were less abundant during the cool, wet summer with moderate snow cover, and shorebirds and gulls declined with lemming abundance. The abundance of geese did not vary over time, possibly because benefits created by moderate spring snow cover were offset by increased fox predation when lemmings were scarce. Our study provides an example of a simple way to monitor the correlation between weather, spring snow cover, lemming abundance, and spatiotemporal variations in Arctic-breeding birds.},

  abstract = {Invertebrates provide the majority of ecosystem services; thus, it is important that they be inventoried, monitored, and protected. Nevertheless, inventories, monitoring, and management generally focus on vertebrates and flowering plants. Consequently, there are few guidelines or case studies for invertebrates. We present a procedure for developing a monitoring program for species-rich invertebrates that entails (1) characterizing the community; (2) identifying surrogates for biodiversity; and (3) establishing efficient methods to monitor surrogates and any ecologically important or sensitive taxa. We used these procedures, biodiversitybased statistical advances, and a survey of arthropods to develop a monitoring plan for the forests of Shenandoah National Park, Virginia (U.S.A.). Our case study revealed that mixed hardwood and hemlock forests had significantly different compositions of arthropods in their soil and understory strata. Of the 10 orders tested Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were the only two to pass most of the five surrogate tests, and their combination improved predictions of overall arthropod diversity. Because arthropods represent the majority of macroscopic species in most ecosystems, the ability of this assemblage to predict overall arthropod diversity makes it a powerful surrogate. Of the 11 collecting methods used, the beat-sheet method was the most efficient for monitoring this surrogate assemblage. To complement this coarse-filter approach to monitoring at-risk, invasive, or other important taxa ( fine filter), we used ordination analyses to match 66 taxa with the methods that most effectively sampled them. Our methods serve as a model for developing an invertebrate monitoring plan and should facilitate linking such monitoring with ecosystem functions and management.},

  abstract = {Modeling nest\textendash survival data: a comparison of recently developed methods that can be implemented in MARK and SAS.\textemdash{} Estimating nest success and evaluating factors potentially related to the survival rates of nests are key aspects of many studies of avian populations. A strong interest in nest success has led to a rich literature detailing a variety of estimation methods for this vital rate. In recent years, modeling approaches have undergone especially rapid development. Despite these advances, most researchers still employ Mayfield's ad\textendash hoc method (Mayfield, 1961) or, in some cases, the maximum\textendash likelihood estimator of Johnson (1979) and Bart \& Robson (1982). Such methods permit analyses of stratified data but do not allow for more complex and realistic models of nest survival rate that include covariates that vary by individual, nest age, time, etc. and that may be continuous or categorical. Methods that allow researchers to rigorously assess the importance of a variety of biological factors that might affect nest survival rates can now be readily implemented in Program MARK and in SAS's Proc GENMOD and Proc NLMIXED. Accordingly, use of Mayfield's estimator without first evaluating the need for more complex models of nest survival rate cannot be justified. With the goal of increasing the use of more flexible methods, we first describe the likelihood used for these models and then consider the question of what the effective sample size is for computation of AICc. Next, we consider the advantages and disadvantages of these different programs in terms of ease of data input and model construction; utility/flexibility of generated estimates and predictions; ease of model selection; and ability to estimate variance components. An example data set is then analyzed using both MARK and SAS to demonstrate implementation of the methods with various models that contain nest\textendash, group\textendash{} (or block\textendash ), and time\textendash specific covariates. Finally, we discuss improvements that would, if they became available, promote a better general understanding of nest survival rates.},

  abstract = {Hudson Bay remains frozen or is dominated by ice over the summer solstice and throughout much of the high-sun season. This contributes directly to the winterization of summer. The juxtaposition of the mean summer position of the Arctic front and of treeline to the west of Hudson Bay has been clearly documented, and the coincidence of treeline and the southern boundary of continuous permafrost is well known. The strong southward thrust of the Arctic front in summer is, in major degree, a response to cold air masses spawned over Hudson Bay.On a mesoscale, Hudson Bay generates onshore winds across a strong temperature and pressure gradient. This mesoscale regime dominates the temperature and surface energy balance for a large distance inland across the Hudson Bay Lowlands. Superimposed on the mesoscale wind field is a land-sea breeze, which is sometimes well developed in coastal areas and which can be traced up to 65 km inland. It is, however, of low frequency occurrence and is usually overridden by the regional wind.Progressing inland from the coast, in the central Hudson Bay Lowlands, the landscape becomes dominated by deep peat soils and a surface vegetation which is resistant to evapotranspiration. As a result, it is much drier than the wetlands near the coast and evapotranspiration is reduced.The large-scale cold air masses originating over Hudson Bay and the cold mesoscale winds combine to impose cold air temperatures on the adjacent terrestrial environment. Even with abundant solar radiation and saturated surfaces, evaporation is vigorously suppressed by these cold temperatures. Any warming or cooling during climate change will have a double impact on the terrestrial environment through the strong linkages with Hudson Bay.},

  abstract = {Region 2 comprises arctic and subarctic North America and is underlain by continuous or discontinuous permafrost. Its freshwater systems are dominated by a low energy environment and cold region processes. Central northern areas are almost totally influenced by arctic air masses while Pacific air becomes more prominent in the west, Atlantic air in the east and southern air masses at the lower latitudes. Air mass changes will play an important role in precipitation changes associated with climate warming. The snow season in the region is prolonged resulting in long-term storage of water so that the spring flood is often the major hydrological event of the year, even though, annual rainfall usually exceeds annual snowfall. The unique character of ponds and lakes is a result of the long frozen period, which affects nutrient status and gas exchange during the cold season and during thaw. GCM models are in close agreement for this region and predict temperature increases as large as 4\textdegree C in summer and 9\textdegree C in winter for a 2 \texttimes{} CO2 scenario. Palaeoclimate indicators support the probability that substantial temperature increases have occurred previously during the Holocene. The historical record indicates a temperature increase of {$>$} 1\textdegree C in parts of the region during the last century. GCM predictions of precipitation change indicate an increase, but there is little agreement amongst the various models on regional disposition or magnitude. Precipitation change is as important as temperature change in determining the water balance. The water balance is critical to every aspect of hydrology and limnology in the far north. Permafrost close to the surface plays a major role in freshwater systems because it often maintains lakes and wetlands above an impermeable frost table, which limits the water storage capabilities of the subsurface. Thawing associated with climate change would, particularly in areas of massive ice, stimulate landscape changes, which can affect every aspect of the environment. The normal spring flooding of ice-jammed north-flowing rivers, such as the Mackenzie, is a major event, which renews the water supply of lakes in delta regions and which determines the availability of habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate warming or river damming and diversion would probably lead to the complete drying of many delta lakes. Climate warming would also change the characteristics of ponds that presently freeze to the bottom and result in fundamental changes in their limnological characteristics. At present, the food chain is rather simple usually culminating in lake trout or arctic char. A lengthening of the growing season and warmer water temperature would affect the chemical, mineral and nutrient status of lakes and most likely have deleterious effects on the food chain. Peatlands are extensive in region 2. They would move northwards at their southern boundaries, and, with sustained drying, many would change form or become inactive. Extensive wetlands and peatlands are an important component of the global carbon budget, and warmer and drier conditions would most likely change them from a sink to a source for atmospheric carbon. There is some evidence that this may be occurring already. Region 2 is very vulnerable to global warming. Its freshwater systems are probably the least studied and most poorly understood in North America. There are clear needs to improve our current knowledge of temperature and precipitation patterns; to model the thermal behaviour of wetlands, lakes and rivers; to understand better the interrelationships of cold region rivers with their basins; to begin studies on the very large lakes in the region; to obtain a firm grasp of the role of northern peatlands in the global carbon cycle; and to link the terrestrial water balance to the thermal and hydrological regime of the polar sea. Overall, there is a strong need for basic research and long-term monitoring. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A seasonal decline in clutch size is typical of bird populations. This phenomenon may result from a conflict between the advantages of early breeding (greater offspring value) and the advantages of delay (greater accumulated condition and hence clutch size). We construct a dynamic model for adaptive seasonal decline in clutch size on the basis of these premises. The model requires a small number of well-supported assumptions; it is formulated and analyzed in both analytical and graphical forms. We outline some novel predictions and suggest tests of our conclusions. Initial comparisons of our predictions with results available from wild birds in the field are favorable. We briefly extend the model to consider the evolution of multiple clutches within a season and the effects of between-season costs of reproduction. Although this work focuses on avian clutch size, the analysis provides a general framework for studies of conditiondependent transitions in life histories. Such transitions between stages (e.g., maturation, metamorpbosis, or reproduction) characterize the ontogeny of organisms. We expect that such conflicts between the advantages of early and late transitions are common to life-history decisions},

  volume = {60},
  pages = {8},
  abstract = {Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, i describe a class of models (n-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, n, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for n. Carroll and lombard (1985, journal of american statistical association 80, 423-426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on n that is exploited by the n-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the n-mixture estimator compared to the caroll and lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Food availability is an important environmental cue for animals for deciding how much to invest in reproduction, and it ultimately affects population size. The importance of food limitation has been extensively studied in terrestrial vertebrate populations, especially in birds, by experimentally manipulating food supply. However, the factors explaining variation in reproductive decisions in response to food supplementation remain unclear. By performing meta-analyses, we aim to quantify the extent to which supplementary feeding affects several reproductive parameters in birds, and identify the key factors (life-history traits, behavioural factors, environmental factors, and experimental design) that can induce variation in laying date, clutch size and breeding success (i.e., number of fledglings produced) in response to food supplementation. Results: Food supplementation produced variable but mostly positive effects across reproductive parameters in a total of 201 experiments from 82 independent studies. The outcomes of the food effect were modulated by environmental factors, e.g., laying dates advanced more towards low latitudes, and food supplementation appeared not to produce any obvious effect on bird reproduction when the background level of food abundance in the environment was high. Moreover, the increase in clutch size following food addition was more pronounced in birds that cache food, as compared to birds that do not. Supplementation timing was identified as a major cause of variation in breeding success responses. We also document the absence of a detectable food effect on clutch size and breeding success when the target species had poor access to the feed due to competitive interactions with other animals. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, from the pool of bird species and environments reviewed, extra food is allocated to immediate reproduction in most cases. Our results also support the view that bird species have evolved different life-history strategies to cope with environmental variability in food supply. However, we encourage more research at low latitudes to gain knowledge on how resource allocation in birds changes along a latitudinal gradient. Our results also emphasize the importance of developing experimental designs that minimise competition for the supplemented food and the risk of reproductive bottle-necks due to inappropriate supplementation timings.},

Using experimental studies that manipulated parental effort in birds, we show that (i) the effect of parental effort on survival was similar across species regardless of phylogeny; (ii) individuals that experienced reduced parental effort had similar survival probabilities than control individuals, regardless of sex; and (iii) males that experienced increased parental effort were less likely to survive than control males, whereas females that experienced increased effort were just as likely to survive as control females. Our results suggest that the trade-off between parental effort and survival is more complex than previously assumed. Finally, our study provides recommendations of unexplored avenues of future research into life-history trade-offs.},

  abstract = {Predation is a key source of seed mortality in many weed species and thus is a part of natural control. In the field, the intensity of seed predation by invertebrates varies during the course of a year. One source of this variation is fluctuations in ambient temperature. Here, the effect of temperature on seed consumption is investigated for the first time, using two abundant carabid seed predators, Pseudoophonus rufipes and Harpalus affinis (Coleoptera: Carabidae), and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) as a model system. Field collected individuals were sexed, kept at one of six constant temperatures between 10 and 28\textdegree C and provided with a surplus of seed. Seed consumption was recorded over a period of 4days. Averaged over all the temperatures, the smaller H. affinis consumed 12.2 seeds day-1 and larger P. rufipes 29 seeds day-1. On average, females consumed more seeds than males. Seed consumption by both species increased with temperature. In H. affinis the increase was linear and different for males and females. In P. rufipes the consumption was similar in both sexes but curvilinear because there was no further increase in consumption above 20\textdegree C. Assuming a linear relationship between temperature and consumption at up to 20\textdegree C we calculated the temperature at which seed consumption ceased (-0.1 to 0.3\textdegree C in H. affinis and 6.3\textendash 6.9\textdegree C in P. rufipes) and the increment in seed consumption per 1\textdegree C increase in temperature above this threshold (0.4\textendash 1.0 and 1.5\textendash 4.2 seeds individual-1 day-1, respectively) for the two species. Thus, it is possible to calculate the average daily consumption of each species over a range of temperatures up to 20\textdegree C.},

The occurrence of these changes and their interactive eects on biological systems are worldwide; thus, an eective global change research and impact assessment program must be based on international and interdisciplinary research and communication. With this in mind, several collaborative research networks with a focus on global change have been established in the biological sciences.

  abstract = {Models for estimating survival probability of nests and young have changed dramatically since the development of the Mayfield method. Improvements in software and a steady increase in computing power have allowed more complexity and realism in these models, allowing researchers to provide better estimates of survival and to relate survival rates to relevant covariates. However, many current analysis methods utilize fixed-effects models with the implicit assumption that the covariates explain all of the variation in the data, other than random variation within a specified family of distributions. This is generally a strong assumption, and, in the presence of heterogeneity and lack of independence, these estimates have been shown to be negatively biased. Others have begun to explore random-effects models for these situations, but a readily applicable Bayesian approach has been lacking. We present a general Bayesian modeling framework appropriate for survival of both nests and young that simultaneously allows for the inclusion of individual covariates and random effects and provides a measure of goodness-of-fit. We used previously published data on survival of Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) ducklings in interior Alaska and on nest survival in three species of prairie-nesting ducks that nested in the Missouri Coteau region of North Dakota to demonstrate this approach. The inclusion of a brood-level random effect in the Common Goldeneye example increased point estimates and credible interval [CI] coverage from . (\% CI: .\textendash .) and . (\% CI: .\textendash .) for  and , respectively, to . (\% CI: .\textendash .) and . (\% CI: .\textendash .) for  and , respectively.

Gosling (PC scores based on culmen and tarsus) size was positively correlated with resighting rate (P = 0.005), indicating that larger goslings survived at a higher rate than did smaller goslings. Gosling size was correlated with adult size of the same individuals (P = 0.0004). Larger goslings were more likely to breed as 2- or 3-yrolds than were medium or small goslings (P = 0.008). Larger adult brant laid more eggs (P = 0.03) and produced clutches with greater total volume (P = 0.03) than did smaller brant. Given the important role of foraging environment in growth of goslings, these data suggest an important role of early environment in determining life-history traits.},

Warming is also evident over the central Arctic Ocean. There is a downward tendency in sea ice extent, attended by warming and increased areal extent of the Arctic Ocean's Atlantic layer. Negative snow cover anomalies have dominated over both continents since the late 1980s and terrestrial precipitation has increased since 1900. Small Arctic glaciers have exhibited generally negative mass balances. While permafrost has warmed in Alaska and Russia, it has cooled in eastern Canada. There is evidence of increased plant growth, attended by greater shrub abundance and northward migration of the tree line. Evidence also suggests that the tundra has changed from a net sink to a net source of atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

This is likely due to environmental changes that alter factors such as food availability that may have an impact on survival and/or breeding success. We tested the impact of experimentally supplemented food on the breeding success over three years of northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe), a species in decline over much of Europe. The number of offspring fledged over the season was higher for food-supplemented birds than for control birds. The mechanisms for this effect were that food supplementation advanced breeding date, which, together with increased resources, allowed further breeding attempts. While food supplementation did not increase the clutch size, hatching success or number of chicks fledged per breeding attempt, it did increase chick size in one year of the study. The increased breeding success was greater for males than females; males could attempt to rear simultaneous broods with multiple females as well as attempting second broods, whereas females could only increase their breeding effort via second broods. Multiple brooding is rare in the study population, but this study demonstrates the potential for changes in food availability to affect wheatear breeding productivity, primarily via phenotypic flexibility in the number of breeding attempts. Our results have implications for our understanding of how wheatears may respond to natural changes in food availability due to climate changes or changes in habitat management.},

Growth patterns were described using a double-Richards growth curve, i.e. a growth curve that also accounted for the prefledging mass loss. We also identified the Linear Growth Phase (i.e. when nestlings grew at the fastest rate). Results Mortality increased with hatching order and decreased with brood size. Mortality was highest for fourth-hatched nestlings, none of which survived. Nestlings hatched late in the season grew faster, experienced the fastest growth rate at a younger age, but reached a lower maximum weight than nestlings hatched early in the season. Nestlings from large broods reached a lower maximum weight than those of small ones. Nestlings gained more mass when temperature was slightly higher than that expected from the seasonal temperature trend, and on rainy and windy days. Conclusion Common Swift nestlings' growth, but not survival, was affected by meteorological conditions, with moderate rainfall, moderate winds and high temperatures favouring greater mass gain. Higher intra-brood competition resulted in slower growth and lower maximum weight. Late-hatched nestlings grew faster but reached a lower maximum weight and a lower pre-fledging mass, possibly suggesting that late-hatched nestlings adaptively tune their growth pattern to the approaching onset of migration to their African wintering quarters. Our results emphasize the importance of exploring weather effects on the breeding biology of a species in different portions of its distribution range that are characterized by contrasting climatic conditions.},

Step-selection functions (SSFs) are commonly used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine temporal resolution. SSFs are estimated by comparing observed steps connecting successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat- and movement-related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and movement processes or to control one process while investigating the other. The fitted model can also be used to estimate utilization distributions and mechanistic home ranges. Here, we present the R package amt (animal movement tools) that allows users to fit SSFs to data and to simulate space use of animals from fitted models. The amt package also provides tools for managing telemetry data. Using fisher (Pekania pennanti) data as a case study, we illustrate a four-step approach to the analysis of animal movement data, consisting of data management, exploratory data analysis, fitting of models, and simulating from fitted models.},

Parents offered supplemental food fed their young more (volume per unit time) than unsupplemented parents in 2 yr of experimentation. In 1986, food-supplemented nestlings had greater mass and linear measures, whereas in 1987, most food-supplemented nestlings had greater mass, but not linear dimensions, than their controls. In 1986, survivorship of young both in the nest and during 4-6 wk after fledging, was greater with food supplementation than without. In 1987, survivorship differences were not significant. Food supplementation enhanced annual reproduction of parents because more food-supplemented Cactus Wrens laid second clutches than controls in 1987, the only year when this was examined. We conclude that food availability during the nestling stage can limit present reproduction, enhance the likelihood of additional reproduction, or both, in Cactus Wrens.

Raw counts from single or repeated visits to sample point(s) are nonetheless still used for assessing community composition, and the failure to account for detectability when making these evaluations may lead to incorrect inferences about the community. We estimated detection probabilities (P) for a suite of bird species and used these detection probabilities to determine the minimum number of visits at a single point and the minimum number of points in a grid required to confidently ({$\geq$}90\%) detect the full community of birds for rare, moderately rare, and common species. We used occupancy modelling to estimate the detection probabilities for species from two study sites in Nebraska and Saskatchewan. Some common or highly detectable species were confidently detected in a single visit to a point, whereas others with low detection probabilities (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}20) required more than ten visits to be confidently detected at a point. The grid size required to detect a species in an area varied from a single point for a common highly detectable species to over 30 points for a rare species with low detectability. Detection probabilities of the least detectable species in a study area can be used to determine the number of visits to a single point or the number of points in a grid to be confident that the full community is detected. Biologists can conclude that a species is most likely absent from the community if it remains undetected using the appropriate sampling effort.},

  abstract = {Asymmetric sibling competition, which occurs when some siblings hatch as stronger competitors than others, is an important component of avian reproductive strategies. Here, we report two experiments on the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides investigating how parents might influence the outcome of asymmetric sibling competition. In this species, as in altricial birds, different-aged offspring compete for resources provided by the parents. However, unlike altricial birds, offspring depend only partially on their parents for resources, and parents adjust the brood size directly through filial cannibalism. In the first experiment, we compared the growth and survivorship of different-aged offspring when parents could and could not influence asymmetric sibling competition. In the second experiment, we recorded behavioral interactions between different-aged offspring and parents. We found that senior offspring (early-hatched) grew faster than juniors (late-hatched) when parents were present and could influence the outcome of sibling competition, whereas seniors and juniors grew at similar rates when parents were removed. Thus, seniors benefited more than did juniors when the offspring could obtain resources by begging from the female parent. There was no difference in the survivorship of seniors and juniors. We also found that seniors and juniors spent a similar amount of time feeding from female parents, but juniors spent more time begging and were less effective at begging than seniors. Interestingly, juniors spent more time begging only as long as seniors also begged, suggesting that juniors adjusted their begging effort in response to direct competition against seniors for resources provided by parents. Our study provides novel insights into the ecological significance of asymmetric sibling competition by showing that asymmetric sibling competition took place when parents were present and offspring could obtain resources by begging. In contrast, we found no evidence of asymmetric sibling competition when parents were absent and offspring obtained resources solely by self-feeding.},

These surface waters are often hotspots of biodiversity and production for microorganisms, plants, and animals in this otherwise extreme terrestrial environment. However, shallow ponds are also especially susceptible to the effects of climatic changes because of their relatively low water volumes and high surface area to depth ratios. Here, we describe our findings that some high Arctic ponds, which paleolimnological data indicate have been permanent water bodies for millennia, are now completely drying during the polar summer. By comparing recent pond water specific conductance values to similar measurements made in the 1980s, we link the disappearance of the ponds to increased evaporation/precipitation ratios, probably associated with climatic warming. The final ecological threshold for these aquatic ecosystems has now been crossed: complete desiccation.},

  abstract = {Livestock grazing is the dominant land use in the remaining seminatural grasslands in Europe. Abandonment of grasslands and, conversely, intensified grazing by livestock have been suggested as possible causes for the widespread population declines of many farmland birds, although the direct impact of grazing on farmland birds is poorly known. Here, we use a comprehensive, long-term data set (20 pastures surveyed over five years) to test the effects of changes in grazing intensities in seminatural dry pastures on between-year variation of the farmland bird community, functional groups of species, and individual species. Bird communities in all 20 seminatural pastures showed a low degree of temporal variability (Kendall's coefficient of concordance on ranked abundances: mean W = 0.72, range = 0.58-0.89). Community variability was not significantly related to site area, grazing pressure, vegetation structure, or adjacent habitat composition. However, analyses of functional groups of species categorized according to body mass and breeding diet showed that different species subsets had differential responses to between-year changes in grazing pressure (as reflected by changes in grass height). Local extinction and recolonization of ground-feeding insectivorous bird species were affected by yearly changes in grazing pressure, but there was no effect of grazing on ground-feeding species that fed on a mixed diet or on species that foraged in trees and shrubs. In general, large insectivores ({$>$}30 g) preferred moderately grazed pastures, and small insectivores ('30 g) preferred pastures with intensive grazing pressure. We propose that current intensive grazing should be relaxed (i.e., by reducing the number of stock per hectare or by within-season rotational grazing) so that with a given stock size, larger areas of seminatural dry pastures could be grazed. This would decrease the rate of habitat loss and conserve a larger part of the farmland bird community breeding in this habitat.},

  abstract = {Circadian clocks are centrally involved in the regulation of daily behavioural and physiological processes. These clocks are synchronized to the 24 h day by external cues (Zeitgeber), the most important of which is the light-dark cycle. In polar environments, however, the strength of the Zeitgeber is greatly reduced around the summer and winter solstices (continuous daylight or continuous darkness). How animals time their behaviour under such conditions has rarely been studied in the wild. Using a radio-telemetry-based system, we investigated daily activity rhythms under continuous daylight in Barrow, Alaska, throughout the breeding season in four bird species that differ in mating system and parental behaviour. We found substantial diversity in daily activity rhythms depending on species, sex and breeding stage. Individuals exhibited either robust, entrained 24 h activity cycles, were continuously active (arrhythmic) or showed 'free-running' activity cycles. In semipalmated sandpipers, a shorebird with biparental incubation, we show that the free-running rhythm is synchronized between pair mates. The diversity of diel time-keeping under continuous daylight emphasizes the plasticity of the circadian system, and the importance of the social and life-history context. Our results support the idea that circadian behaviour can be adaptively modified to enable species-specific time-keeping under polar conditions.},

  abstract = {Climate warming is causing unidirectional changes to annual patterns of sea ice distribution, structure, and freezeup. We summarize evidence that documents how loss of sea ice, the primary habitat of polar bears (Ursus maritimus), negatively affects their long-term survival. To maintain viable subpopulations, polar bears depend on sea ice as a platform from which to hunt seals for long enough each year to accumulate sufficient energy (fat) to survive periods when seals are unavailable. Less time to access to prey, because of progressively earlier breakup in spring, when newly weaned ringed seal (Pusa hispida) young are available, results in longer periods of fasting, lower body condition, decreased access to denning areas, fewer and smaller cubs, lower survival of cubs as well as bears of other age classes and, finally, subpopulation decline toward eventual extirpation. The chronology of climate-driven changes will vary between subpopulations, with quantifiable negative effects being documented first in the more southerly subpopulations, such as those in Hudson Bay or the southern Beaufort Sea. As the bears' body condition declines, more seek alternate food resources so the frequency of conflicts between bears and humans increases. In the most northerly areas, thick multiyear ice, through which little light penetrates to stimulate biological growth on the underside, will be replaced by annual ice, which facilitates greater productivity and may create habitat more favorable to polar bears over continental shelf areas in the short term. If the climate continues to warm and eliminate sea ice as predicted, polar bears will largely disappear from the southern portions of their range by midcentury. They may persist in the northern Canadian Arctic Islands and northern Greenland for the foreseeable future, but their long-term viability, with a much reduced global population size in a remnant of their former range, is uncertain.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop a method by means of which it is possible to produce georeferenced ecological information about the habitat requirements of different species. The integrated habitat suitability index approach includes the steps of constructing habitat suitability models, producing data needed in models, evaluating of target areas based on habitat factors, and combining various suitability indices. The method relies on the combined use of empirical evaluation models and models based on expertise in geographical information system (GIS) environment. GIS was used to produce the data needed in the models, and as a platform to execute the models and to present the results of the analysis. Furthermore, multi-criteria evaluation methods (MCEs) provide the technical tools for modeling the expertise and for connecting (standardizing, weighting, and combining) the habitat needs of different species. The main advantages of the method were connected to possibilities to consider the habitat factors on different scales, to combine habitat suitability evaluations for several species and to weight different species in different ways, and to integrate empirical models and expert knowledge. The method is illustrated by a case study in which an integrated habitat suitability map is produced for a group of old-forest species.},

We therefore designed an R package called popbio to facilitate both the construction and analysis of projection matrix models. The package consists primarily of the R translation of MATLAB code found in Caswell (2001) and Morris and Doak (2002) for the analysis of projection matrix models. The package also includes methods to estimate vital rates and construct projection matrix models from census data typically collected in plant demography studies. In these studies, vital rates can often be estimated directly from annual censuses of tagged individuals using transition frequency tables. Because the construction of projection matrix models requires careful management of census data, we describe the steps to construct a projection matrix in detail.},

  abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is increasingly popular in ecological research and conservation programs, with high-volume and long-term data collection provided by automatized acoustic sensors offering unprecedented opportunities for faunal and ecosystem surveys. Practitioners and newcomers interested in PAM can easily find technical specifications for acoustic sensors and microphones, but guidelines on how to plan survey designs are largely scattered over the literature. Here, we (i) review spatial and temporal sampling designs used in passive acoustic monitoring, (ii) provide a synthesis of the crucial aspects of PAM survey design and (iii) propose a workflow to optimize recording autonomy and recording schedules. From 1992 to 2018, most of the 460 studies applying PAM in terrestrial environments have used a single recorder per site, covered broad spatial scales and rotated recorders between sites to optimize sampling effort. Continuous recording of specific diel periods was the main recording procedure used. When recording schedules were applied, a larger number of recordings per hour was generally associated with a smaller recording length. For PAM survey design, we proposed to (i) estimate memory/battery autonomy and associated costs, (ii) assess signal detectability to optimize recording schedules in order to recover maximum biological information and (iii) evaluate cost-benefit scenarios between sampling effort and budget to address potential biases from a given PAM survey design. Establishing standards for PAM data collection will improve the quality of inferences over the broad scope of PAM research and promote essential standardization for cross-scale research to understand long-term biodiversity trends in a changing world.},

Hosts may respond to parasitism by differential investment in offspring depending on their ability to cope with parasitism, because offspring that perform better than their siblings are themselves likely to have superior induced or genetic resistance. We tested whether nestlings of the highly colonial sand martin Riparia riparia were affected by the haematophagous tick Ixodes lividus by experimentally manipulating parasite loads of nests [nests sprayed with pyrethrum to remove parasites (sprayed), or nests sprayed with water (control)] at three stages of the breeding season. Prevalence and intensity of ticks were significantly affected by treatments. Breeding success was not significantly affected by treatment, although post-fledging survival was twice as high among nestlings from sprayed nests than from controls. Mean phenotypic traits of nestlings generally did not differ significantly among treatments, while within-brood variance in keel length (a skeletal character) and body mass were higher in control treatment broods than sprayed ones. Sedimentation rate, which reflects blood protein and immunoglobulin content, was significantly higher and less variable in sprayed than control broods. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that parasitism effects on host reproductive success act through an increase in the variance of offspring quality.},

Repeat photography shows that there has been an increase in shrub cover over the past 50 years in northern Alaska. Using 202 pairs of old and new oblique aerial photographs, we have found that across this region spanning 620 km east to west and 350 km north to south, alder, willow, and dwarf birch have been increasing, with the change most easily detected on hill slopes and valley bottoms. Plot and remote sensing studies from the same region using the normalized difference vegetation index are consistent with the photographic results and indicate that the smaller shrubs between valleys are also increasing. In Canada, Scandinavia, and parts of Russia, there is both plot and remote sensing evidence for shrub expansion. Combined with the Alaskan results, the evidence suggests that a pan-Arctic vegetation transition is underway. If continued, this transition will alter the fundamental architecture and function of this ecosystem with important ramifications for the climate, the biota, and humans.},

  abstract = {Avian point-count surveys are typically designed to occur during periods when birds are consistently active and singing, but seasonal and diurnal patterns of detection probability are often not well understood and may vary regionally or between years. We deployed autonomous acoustic recorders to assess how avian availability for detection (i.e., the probability that a bird signals its presence during a recording) varied during the breeding season with time of day, date, and weather-related variables at multiple subarctic tundra sites in Alaska, USA, 2013\textendash 2014. A single observer processed 2,692 10-minute recordings across 11 site-years. We used time-removal methods to assess availability and used generalized additive models to examine patterns of detectability (joint probability of presence, availability, and detection) for 16 common species. Despite lack of distinct dawn or dusk, most species displayed circadian vocalization patterns, with detection rates generally peaking between 0800 hours and 1200 hours but remaining high as late as 2000 hours for some species. Between 2200 hours and 0500 hours, most species' detection rates dropped to near 0, signaling a distinctive rest period. Detectability dropped sharply for most species in early July. For all species considered, time-removal analysis indicated nearly 100\% likelihood of detection during a 10-minute recording conducted in June, between 0500 hours and 2000 hours. This indicates that non-detections during appropriate survey times and dates were attributable to the species' absence or that silent birds were unlikely to initiate singing during a 10-minute interval, whereas vocally active birds were singing very frequently. Systematic recordings revealed a gradient of species' presence at each site, from ubiquitous to incidental. Although the total number of species detected at a site ranged from 16 to 27, we detected only 4 to 15 species on {$\geq$}5\% of the site's recordings. Recordings provided an unusually detailed and consistent dataset that allowed us to identify, among other things, appropriate survey dates and times for species breeding at northern latitudes. Our results also indicated that more recordings of shorter duration (1\textendash 4 min) may be most efficient for detecting passerines.},

While arctic flowers are visited by a wide range of insects, flies in family Muscidae have been proposed as a pollinator group of particular importance. To understand the functional outcome of current changes in pollinator community composition, we examined the role of muscids in the pollination of a key plant species, the mountain avens (Dryas). We monitored the seed set of Dryas across 15 sites at Zackenberg, northeast Greenland, and used sticky flower mimics and DNA barcoding to describe the flower-visiting community at each site. To evaluate the consequences of shifts in pollinator phenology under climate change, we compared the flower visitors between the early and the late season. Our approach revealed a diverse community of insects visiting Dryas, including two-thirds of all insect species known from the area. Even against this diverse background, the abundance of muscid flies emerged as a key predictor for seed set in Dryas, whereas overall insect abundance and species richness had little or no effect. With muscid flies as the main drivers of the pollinating function in the High Arctic, a recently observed decline in their abundances offers cause for concern.},

  abstract = {This paper advances a unified approach to the modeling of sigmoid organismal growth. There are numerous studies on growth, and there have been several proposals and applications of candidate models. Still, a lack of interpretation of the parameter values persists and, consequently, differences in growth patterns have riddled this field. A candidate regression model as a tool should be able to assess and compare growth-curve shapes, systematically and precisely. The Richards models constitute a useful family of growth models that amongst a multitude of parameterizations, re-parameterizations and special cases, include familiar models such as the negative exponential, the logistic, the Bertalanffy and the Gompertz. We have reviewed and systemized this family of models. We demonstrate that two specific parameterizations (or re-parameterizations) of the Richards model are able to substitute, and thus to unify all other forms and models. This unified-Richards model (with its two forms) constitutes a powerful tool for an interpretation of important characteristics of observed growth patterns, namely, [I] maximum (relative) growth rate (i.e., slope at inflection), [II] age at maximum growth rate (i.e., time at inflection), [III] relative mass or length at maximum growth rate (i.e., relative value at an inflection), [IV] value at age zero (i.e., birth, hatching or germination), and [V] asymptotic value (i.e., adult weight or length). These five parameters can characterize uniquely any sigmoid-growth data. To date most studies only compare what is referred to as the ``growth-rate constant'' or simply ``growth rate'' (k). This parameter can be interpreted as neither relative nor actual growth rate, but only as a parameter that affects the slope at inflection. We fitted the unified-Richards and five other candidate models to six artificial data sets, generated from the same models, and made a comparison based on the corrected Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc). The outcome may in part be the result of the random generation of data points. Still, in conclusion, the unified-Richards model performed consistently well for all data sets, despite the penalty imposed by the AICc.},

We fitted the models to two empirical data sets of chick growth (six biometric measurements) of African black oystercatchers Haematopus moquini from South Africa and little stints Calidris minuta from Russia, and identified the best-fitting growth curves by Akaike's information criterion. We also determine fitted and derived parameters, including the relative value (size) at hatching, the placement of inflection, the (normalised) growth rate constant, and the adult value (upper asymptote). The preferred model together with these factors describes how fast (or abruptly) the curves asymptote, and illustrates why growth is poorly characterised by the growth rate constant alone. Though the extreme value function model has not (as far as we know) been applied to chick growth data before, it appears to return the best fit for some parameters in our data sets. For example, we found that in African black oystercatchers two very different models best characterise two of the measurements: the extreme value function model and the Bertalanffy model for tarsus growth and body mass growth, respectively. In addition, we discuss the usefulness of fixing the upper asymptote to the adult value (e.g., adult body mass) and recommend a fixed upper asymptote in most cases.},

  abstract = {The study focuses on vegetation changes in the Nordic mountain birch forest in northern Norway, covering a period of more than 40 yr. The study area comprises the municipalities of Kautokeino and Karasjok on Finnmarkskvidda; it is predominantly covered by lichen and dwarf shrub vegetation. Sizes of various vegetation classes were estimated by the use of remote-sensing techniques and ground surveys. A significant change in vegetation cover during the study period was registered in the whole study area. Vegetation types dominated by bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia fleuxuosa), the dwarf cornel (Cornus suecica), and mosses have tripled in abundance compared to 40 yr ago. In contrast, lichen-dominated heaths and woodland (forests), preferred by the reindeer stocks intensively utilizing these areas of Finnmarksvidda, have decreased by approximately 80\% in abundance during the same period. Correspondingly, there has been a significant increase in the extent of birch forests especially in Kautokeino (90\% increase). The reason for the steep decline in lichen-dominated areas appears to be a direct consequence of the intensive grazing by the increasing reindeer population in the period 1961\textendash 1987, but climate change (increased precipitation), caterpillar attacks, and long-transported air pollution (e.g., nitrogen) may also have accentuated the increase of forests and other vegetation types.},

  abstract = {Birch forests cover large areas of the northern Fennoscandia and the mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) often forming the altitudinal and Arctic forest and tree lines. Interpreting the factors leading to landscape changes in mountain birch forest involves disturbance from anthropogenic use and climate as important factors. Using vegetation maps based on aerial photographs and satellite images from 7 years in combination with statistical data and ground estimation data of biomass in the period 1957\textendash 2006, we were able to assess the transitions among mountain heaths and different types of forest, the displacement of the altitudinal forest line and hence the change in biomass. The tree biomass as well as the growing stock for birch in Finnmarksvidda doubled in the period 1957\textendash 2006. Only lichen biomass has been significantly reduced in the period 1957 to 2000, with a subsequent slight increase of lichen biomass in the period 2000 to 2006. The results presented in this paper show significant and positive relationships between measured tree biomass and the increase in reindeer population in the period 1957\textendash 2006 in the study area. The hypothesis concerning the removal of the ``lichen barrier effect'' by heavy reindeer grazing which leads to increased success for birch seeds to germinate and sprout is therefore considered to be valid. However, also, climate change effects like increased precipitation, moth attacks, freezing and thawing events during winter and long-transported air pollution (e.g. nitrogen) may also have reinforced the changes in biomass. Climatic variables from regional weather stations for the period 1955\textendash 2006 did not, however, reveal any consistent change except for that the increased snow depth had a negative impact on the reindeer population while increase in snow depth hindering the reindeer in grazing seemed to have a positive impact on the lichen biomass. The ongoing development of increased forest cover and hence elevated forest line will lead to reduction of open habitats, and hence decreased grazing accessibility for the reindeer. The effects on forestry and carbon sequestration are also discussed, and here one of the suggestions is to let the northern birch forests act as carbon sinks contributing to the reduction of total net emission of CO2 in the Nordic countries. Land use like reindeer husbandry has shown to strongly affect relationships between ecological processes like tree-growth and climate. Moreover, reindeer husbandry is such a widespread human activity in the arctic and boreal region that it might affect the global carbon budget.},

  abstract = {Snow is a major determinant of forage availability for reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus; hereafter Rangifer) in winter and is, consequently, a medium through which climate variation may influence population dynamics in this species. Periodic ``icing'' of winter ranges, where interludes of mild weather result in formation of crusted snow and basal ice that restrict access to forage, is held to be a cause of mass starvation, catastrophic declines in numbers, and even extirpation of local populations. It has been suggested that warming of the Arctic may result in increased frequency of winters with unfavorable snow and ice conditions, with serious consequences for Rangifer. This paper examines data on major declines in populations of Rangifer to determine the mechanism(s) of these events and the role of snow and ice conditions in them. Thirty-one declines, involving numerical decreases between 25\% and 99\%, were identified in 12 populations. Declines were of two types: the negative phase of irruptive oscillations, mainly associated with populations introduced into new habitat, and numerical fluctuation in persistently unstable established populations. The mechanisms of decline differed widely in both categories, ranging from wholly mortality to almost wholly emigration. In all cases, the observed dynamics are best interpreted as a product of interaction between internal processes (density dependence) and the external abiotic conditions (density independence). The strength and the form of density independence, parameterized in terms of local weather or large-scale climate, varies widely between populations, reflecting the enormous range of climate conditions across the circumpolar distribution of Rangifer. This complicates the search for abiotic components likely to be consistently important determinants of population growth in the species. There are few data demonstrating the presence of extensive hard snow or basal ice on ranges during winter(s) in which populations declined, and none confirming ice as a ubiquitous and potent agent in the dynamics of Rangifer. Instead, where the simultaneous effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors are examined across the full temporal record of dynamics, climatic conditions associated with increased amounts of snow or winter warming are generally found to enhance the abundance of animals, at least in established populations.},

We show that false-negative errors (failure to record a species when in fact it is present) can have a significant impact on statistical estimation of habitat models using simulated data. Then we introduce an extension of logistic modeling, the zero-inflated binomial (ZIB) model that permits the estimation of the rate of false-negative errors and the correction of estimates of the probability of occurrence for false-negative errors by using repeated visits to the same site. Our simulations show that even relatively low rates of false negatives bias statistical estimates of habitat effects. The method with three repeated visits eliminates the bias, but estimates are relatively imprecise. Six repeated visits improve precision of estimates to levels comparable to that achieved with conventional statistics in the absence of false-negative errors. In general, when error rates are Յ50\% greater efficiency is gained by adding more sites, whereas when error rates are Ͼ50\% it is better to increase the number of repeated visits. We highlight the flexibility of the method with three case studies, clearly demonstrating the effect of false-negative errors for a range of commonly used survey methods.},

  abstract = {Both arthropods and large grazing herbivores are important components and drivers of biodiversity in grassland ecosystems, but a synthesis of how arthropod diversity is affected by large herbivores has been largely missing. To fill this gap, we conducted a literature search, which yielded 141 studies on this topic of which 24 simultaneously investigated plant and arthropod diversity. Using the data from these 24 studies, we compared the responses of plant and arthropod diversity to an increase in grazing intensity. This quantitative assessment showed no overall significant effect of increasing grazing intensity on plant diversity, while arthropod diversity was generally negatively affected. To understand these negative effects, we explored the mechanisms by which large herbivores affect arthropod communities: direct effects, changes in vegetation structure, changes in plant community composition, changes in soil conditions, and cascading effects within the arthropod interaction web. We identify three main factors determining the effects of large herbivores on arthropod diversity: (i) unintentional predation and increased disturbance, (ii) decreases in total resource abundance for arthropods (biomass) and (iii) changes in plant diversity, vegetation structure and abiotic conditions. In general, heterogeneity in vegetation structure and abiotic conditions increases at intermediate grazing intensity, but declines at both low and high grazing intensity. We conclude that large herbivores can only increase arthropod diversity if they cause an increase in (a)biotic heterogeneity, and then only if this increase is large enough to compensate for the loss of total resource abundance and the increased mortality rate. This is expected to occur only at low herbivore densities or with spatio-temporal variation in herbivore densities. As we demonstrate that arthropod diversity is often more negatively affected by grazing than plant diversity, we strongly recommend considering the specific requirements of arthropods when applying grazing management and to include arthropods in monitoring schemes. Conservation strategies aiming at maximizing heterogeneity, including regulation of herbivore densities (through human interventions or top-down control), maintenance of different types of management in close proximity and rotational grazing regimes, are the most promising options to conserve arthropod diversity.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {Population dynamics of black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla in Bering Sea colonies are likely to increasingly experience climate-induced changes in the physical environment. Since adult kittiwakes are central place foragers with high energy requirements, increased variability of forage patch dynamics, as predicted for polar regions, may influence both quantity and quality of food available and consequently alter the population dynamics of kittiwake colonies. Here, we describe, conceptualize, and model the effects of environment and energy resources on kittiwake growth, fledging age (from 35 to 50 days) and survival from hatching up to first breeding (post-hatching productivity). For our life-history model, we use a von Bertalanffy growth function for body growth in mass. We model nestling mortality as a function of somatic growth, in order to account for oxidative damage and trade-offs in the allocation of resources, and energy available, since low food availability increases the risk of chicks' starvation and predation risk. In the case of a good environment (i.e., high food availability), the best strategy (i.e., highest post-hatching productivity) is to grow fast (about 18.6 g d-1) and to spend a moderately long time in the nest (up to 45 days), while in the case of a poor environment the best strategy is to grow fast (about 18 g d-1) and leave the nest soon (35\textendash 40 days). Different ages at first breeding do not change the optimal strategies. We discuss the implications of optimal growth strategy in terms of evolution of life histories in kittiwakes and how our work, coupled with models of post-breeding survival and reproductive dynamics, could lead to the development of a full life-history model and the exploration of future evolutionary trajectories for traits like body growth and age at first breeding.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The Arctic is a water-rich region, with freshwater systems covering about 16 \% of the northern permafrost landscape. Permafrost thaw creates new freshwater ecosystems, while at the same time modifying the existing lakes, streams, and rivers that are impacted by thaw. Here, we describe the current state of knowledge regarding how permafrost thaw affects lentic (still) and lotic (moving) systems, exploring the effects of both thermokarst (thawing and collapse of ice-rich permafrost) and deepening of the active layer (the surface soil layer that thaws and refreezes each year). Within thermokarst, we further differentiate between the effects of thermokarst in lowland areas vs. that on hillslopes. For almost all of the processes that we explore, the effects of thaw vary regionally, and between lake and stream systems. Much of this regional variation is caused by differences in ground ice content, topography, soil type, and permafrost coverage. Together, these modifying factors determine (i) the degree to which permafrost thaw manifests as thermokarst, (ii) whether thermokarst leads to slumping or the formation of thermokarst lakes, and (iii) the manner in which constituent delivery to freshwater systems is altered by thaw. Differences in thaw-enabled constituent delivery can be considerable, with these modifying factors determining, for example, the balance between delivery of particulate vs. dissolved constituents, and inorganic vs. organic materials. Changes in the composition of thaw-impacted waters, coupled with changes in lake morphology, can strongly affect the physical and optical properties of thermokarst lakes. The ecology of thaw-impacted lakes and streams is also likely to change; these systems have unique microbiological communities, and show differences in respiration, primary production, and food web structure that are largely driven by differences in sediment, dissolved organic matter, and nutrient delivery. The degree to which thaw enables the delivery of dissolved vs. particulate organic matter, coupled with the composition of that organic matter and the morphology and stratification characteristics of recipient systems will play an important role in determining the balance between the release of organic matter as greenhouse gases (CO\textsubscript{2} and CH\textsubscript{4}), its burial in sediments, and its loss downstream. The magnitude of thaw impacts on northern aquatic ecosystems is increasing, as is the prevalence of thaw-impacted lakes and streams. There is therefore an urgent need to quantify how permafrost thaw is affecting aquatic ecosystems across diverse Arctic landscapes, and the implications of this change for further climate warming.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Colour is an important attractant for many flower-visiting insects (anthophiles). Consequently, coloured pan trapping is an efficient technique that can be easily and cost-effectively used to quantitatively sample assemblages of anthophiles. However, colour preferences of anthophiles is an important source of bias that needs to be considered in pan trap surveys. By drawing sub samples comprised of different colour combinations from a database of pan trap surveys in the lowlands of the Cape Floristic Region, we examine the effects of colour on pan trap catches and determine which combinations of colours might provide better estimates of diversity when sampling with multi-colour sets of pan traps. Pan trap catches included the major groups of anthophiles in the region (Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera), but butterflies (Lepidoptera) were strongly under-represented. Colour played an important role in determining the species richness and composition of pan trap catches, with colour sets that included high reflectance yellow and white generally having catches with the highest species richness. While all colour combinations provided reasonable estimates of proportional species richness, proportional abundance of taxa varied among different colour sets, and did not accurately reflect actual proportions of different taxa in the entire dataset. For comparative biodiversity surveys and assessments we recommend the use of high reflectance colours such as white and yellow traps, while for full inventory surveys, it may be necessary to include other colours to catch rarer species that are excluded by the high reflectance colours alone.},

  abstract = {Food availability is an important limiting factor for avian reproduction. In altricial birds, food limitation is assumed to be more severe during the nestling stage than during laying or incubation, but this has yet to be adequately tested. Using food-supplementation experiments over a 5-year period, we determined the degree and timing of food limitation for burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) breeding in Canada. Burrowing owls are an endangered species and food limitation during the nestling stage could influence reproductive performance of this species at the northern extent of their range. Supplemented pairs fledged on average 47\% more owlets than unfed pairs, except during a year when natural food was not limiting (i.e., a prey irruption year). The difference in fledgling production resulted from high nestling mortality in unfed broods, with 96\% of all nestling deaths being attributed to food shortage. Supplemental feeding during the nestling period also increased fledgling structural size. Pairs fed from the start of laying produced the same number of hatchlings as pairs that received no supplemental food before hatch. Furthermore, pairs supplemented from egg laying to fledging and pairs supplemented during the nestling period alone had the same patterns of nestling survival, equal numbers of fledglings, and similar fledgling mass and structural size. Our results provide empirical support for the hypothesis that the nestling period is the most food-limited phase of the breeding cycle. The experimental design we introduce here could be used with other altricial species to examine how the timing of food limitation differs among birds with a variety of life-history strategies. For burrowing owls, and other species with similar life histories, longterm, large-scale, and appropriately timed habitat management increasing prey abundance or availability is critical for conservation.},

This approach may be particularly appropriate when patterns of occurrence and abundance arise from distinct processes operating at differing spatial or temporal scales. We apply the model to two data sets: (1) previously published data for a species of duck, Anas platyrhynchos, and (2) data for a stream fish species, Etheostoma scotti. We show that in these cases, an incomplete-detection zero-inflated modeling approach yields a superior fit to the data than other models. We propose that zero-inflated abundance models accounting for incomplete detection be considered when replicate count data are available.},

  abstract = {Bee pollinators are currently recorded with many different sampling methods. However, the relative performances of these methods have not been systematically evaluated and compared. In response to the strong need to record ongoing shifts in pollinator diversity and abundance, global and regional pollinator initiatives must adopt standardized sampling protocols when developing large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes. We systematically evaluated the performance of six sampling methods (observation plots, pan traps, standardized and variable transect walks, trap nests with reed internodes or paper tubes) that are commonly used across a wide range of geographical regions in Europe and in two habitat types (agricultural and seminatural). We focused on bees since they represent the most important pollinator group worldwide. Several characteristics of the methods were considered in order to evaluate their performance in assessing bee diversity: sample coverage, observed species richness, species richness estimators, collector biases (identified by subunit-based rarefaction curves), species composition of the samples, and the indication of overall bee species richness (estimated from combined total samples). The most efficient method in all geographical regions, in both the agricultural and seminatural habitats, was the pan trap method. It had the highest sample coverage, collected the highest number of species, showed negligible collector bias, detected similar species as the transect methods, and was the best indicator of overall bee species richness. The transect methods were also relatively efficient, but they had a significant collector bias. The observation plots showed poor performance. As trap nests are restricted to cavity-nesting bee species, they had a naturally low sample coverage. However, both trap nest types detected additional species that were not recorded by any of the other methods. For large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes with surveyors with different experience levels, we recommend pan traps as the most efficient, unbiased, and cost-effective method for sampling bee diversity. Trap nests with reed internodes could be used as a complementary sampling method to maximize the numbers of collected species. Transect walks are the principal method for detailed studies focusing on plant\textendash pollinator associations. Moreover, they can be used in monitoring schemes after training the surveyors to standardize their collection skills.},

  abstract = {Food supply and hatching asynchrony were manipulated for 90 broods of American kestrels (Falco sparverius) during 1989-1991. We measured the growth and mortality of nestlings within four treatment groups (asynchronous, synchronous, food-supplemented, unsupplemented) to test the brood reduction hypothesis of Lack (1947, 1954). Fledging success did not differ between synchronous and asynchronous broods when food was poor but consistent with the brood reduction hypothesis, nestlings died at a younger age in asynchronous broods. When food was supplemented, mortality did not occur in the synchronous broods but youngest nestlings still died in asynchronous nests despite apparently adequate food for the brood. Oldest nestlings in asynchronous broods fledged with a greater mass than their younger siblings, also consistent with Lack's hypothesis. Average nestling quality in synchronous broods was very dependent on food levels. Synchronous young that were supplemented were, on average, the heaviest of any treatment group but young from unsupplemented synchronous broods were the lightest. Overall, patterns of mortality and growth for kestrels support the brood reduction hypothesis when food is limited, but not when it is abundant. This fooddependent benefit of asynchrony in the nestling period is a prerequisite for facultatively adjusted hatching spans during laying.},

  abstract = {Food limitation on reproduction during the nestling stage was experimentally tested in a Finnish population of Eurasian Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). Nests were provided with supplemental food from hatching to fledging for three years (1992, 1993, and 1995), which differed in the natural abundance of voles, the Eurasian Kestrel's major prey. These supplemented nests were compared to nonsupplemented control nests using the following variables: (1) parental effort, (2) parental condition, and (3) fledgling number and quality. Female parents responded to food supplements by decreasing their hunting effort (estimated as the percentage of time spent flight-hunting) and prey delivery rate, whereas the hunting effort and/or prey delivery rate of males did not change. Females at supplemented nests were heavier than those at control nests, but the body mass of males was not affected by feeding. Supplementary food increased the number of fledglings per brood not only in years of low, but also in years of relatively high natural prey density. We conclude that even at high levels of natural food abundance, the reproductive output of kestrels is food-limited during the nestling period. In addition, there appear to be intersexual differences in the adjustment of parental effort. While females adjusted parental effort to male provisioning and offspring requirements, males did not change parental effort within a season, suggesting that male parental effort is fixed at a level where male survival is not jeopardized.},

  abstract = {Ecologists often study wildlife populations by deploying camera traps. Large datasets are generated using this approach which can be difficult for research teams to manually evaluate. Researchers increasingly enlist volunteers from the general public as citizen scientists to help classify images. The growing number of camera trap studies, however, makes it ever more challenging to find enough volunteers to process all projects in a timely manner. Advances in machine learning, especially deep learning, allow for accurate automatic image classification. By training models using existing datasets of images classified by citizen scientists and subsequent application of such models on new studies, human effort may be reduced substantially. The goals of this study were to (a) assess the accuracy of deep learning in classifying camera trap data, (b) investigate how to process datasets with only a few classified images that are generally difficult to model, and (c) apply a trained model on a live online citizen science project. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to differentiate among images of different animal species, images of humans or vehicles, and empty images (no animals, vehicles, or humans). We used four different camera trap datasets featuring a wide variety of species, different habitats, and a varying number of images. All datasets were labelled by citizen scientists on Zooniverse. Accuracies for identifying empty images across projects ranged between 91.2\% and 98.0\%, whereas accuracies for identifying specific species were between 88.7\% and 92.7\%. Transferring information from CNNs trained on large datasets (``transfer-learning'') was increasingly beneficial as the size of the training dataset decreased and raised accuracy by up to 10.3\%. Removing low-confidence predictions increased model accuracies to the level of citizen scientists. By combining a trained model with classifications from citizen scientists, human effort was reduced by 43\% while maintaining overall accuracy for a live experiment running on Zooniverse. Ecology researchers can significantly reduce image classification time and manual effort by combining citizen scientists and CNNs, enabling faster processing of data from large camera trap studies.},

Parents of altricial species are selected to provide parental care (such as food provisioning) for their offspring, but there is substantial variation in the level of this care. Provisioning rate may be determined environmentally, by the physiological ability of parents and needs of nestlings, or by evolutionary incentives. We quantified provisioning rate in 20 purple martin Progne subis nests in the context of an experimental reduction of nest ectoparasites. 10 nests had a parasite reduction treatment, and 10 nests were controls. By using AI to automate the analysis of nest camera videos we were able to obtain nearly-continuous provisioning rate information at a high temporal resolution for the first half of the nestling period. We used random forest modeling to assess the factors determining provisioning rate and found evidence for environmental, evolutionary and physiological constraints and incentives on provisioning. Birds appeared to be environmentally limited in their provisioning in cool, wet conditions, especially later in the breeding season; but adjusted their provisioning according to the changing physiological needs of nestlings. We found evidence for a compensatory response to increased parasite load, in which parents increased provisioning to more heavily parasitized nests.},

  abstract = {The spatial patterning of alpine plant communities is strongly influenced by the variation in physical factors such as temperature and moisture, which are strongly affected by snow depth and snowmelt patterns. Earlier snowmelt timing and greater soil-moisture limitations may favor wide-ranging species adapted to a broader set of ecohydrological conditions than alpine-restricted species. We asked how plant community composition, phenology, plant water relations, and photosynthetic gas exchange of alpine-restricted and wide-ranging species differ in their responses to a ca. 40-day snowmelt gradient in the Colorado Rocky Mountains (Lewisia pygmaea, Sibbaldia procumbens, and Hymenoxys grandiflora were alpine-restricted and Artemisia scopulorum, Carex rupestris, and Geum rossii were wide-ranging species). As hypothesized, species richness and foliar cover increased with earlier snowmelt, due to a greater abundance of wide-ranging species present in earlier melting plots. Flowering initiation occurred earlier with earlier snowmelt for 12 out of 19 species analyzed, while flowering duration was shortened with later snowmelt for six species (all but one were wide-ranging species). We observed {$>$}50\% declines in net photosynthesis from July to September as soil moisture and plant water potentials declined. Early-season stomatal conductance was higher in wide-ranging species, indicating a more competitive strategy for water acquisition when soil moisture is high. Even so, there were no associated differences in photosynthesis or transpiration, suggesting no strong differences between these groups in physiology. Our findings reveal that plant species with different ranges (alpine-restricted vs. wide-ranging) could have differential phenological and physiological responses to snowmelt timing and associated soil moisture dry-down, and that alpine-restricted species' performance is more sensitive to snowmelt. As a result, alpine-restricted species may serve as better indicator species than their wide-ranging heterospecifics. Overall, alpine community composition and peak \% cover are strongly structured by spatio-temporal patterns in snowmelt timing. Thus, near-term, community-wide changes (or variation) in phenology and physiology in response to shifts in snowmelt timing or rates of soil dry down are likely to be contingent on the legacy of past climate on community structure.},

Forcings and feedbacks that impact the warming response are estimated for both Arctic and global regions based on standard model diagnostics. Fitting a zero-dimensional energy balance model to each region, an expression is derived that gives the Arctic amplification as a function of these forcings and feedbacks. Contributing to Arctic amplification are the Arctic-global differences in surface albedo feedback (SAF), longwave feedback and the net top-of-atmosphere flux forcing (the sum of the surface flux and the atmospheric heat transport convergence). The doubled CO2 forcing and non-SAF shortwave feedback oppose Arctic amplification. SAF is shown to be a contributing, but not a dominating, factor in the simulated Arctic amplification and its intermodel variation.},

  abstract = {Male dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, are monogamous and normally help females feed nestlings. We removed males at hatching of their eggs and examined female parental behaviour in response to male removal. We compared parental behaviour of unaided females (experimentals) with that of (1) females aided by their mates (control females) and (2) females and their mates working together (control pairs). Unaided females fed their young at least twice as often as did aided females and as often as the combined efforts of pairs. The increased rate of food delivery by unaided females was accompanied by a decrease in time brooding the young and an increase in the amount of time the female's nest was unattended, suggesting that feeding and brooding are competing parental behaviours. Feeding rates of both unaided females and pairs increased as brood size increased, but the response to brood size was stronger in unaided females than in either aided females or pairs. An earlier study indicated that, despite their compensatory feeding rates, unaided females experienced greater partial brood loss than did pairs. Perhaps males bring more food per feeding trip, or food of a different quality. It seems likely that males can improve fledging success by bringing food to the young, both during the early nestling stage when brooding is crucial and also later, during the period of rapid growth.},

Past research has focused on the characterization of such differences and a quest for their proximate and ultimate causation. However, the consequences of these differences for ecology and evolution received much less attention. Here, we strive to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive inventory of the potential implications of personality differences, ranging from population growth and persistence to species interactions and community dynamics, and covering issues such as social evolution, the speed of evolution, evolvability, and speciation. The emerging picture strongly suggests that personality differences matter for ecological and evolutionary processes (and their interaction) and, thus, should be considered a key dimension of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant intraspecific variation.},

  abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton\textendash Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

Honeybee-pollinated plants, Lotus corniculatus, and its commonly coflowering neighbor, Potentilla reptans var. sericophylla, were used in a two-year project. We designed six types of plant combinations with different conspecific and interspecific flower densities in 2011 and repeated this in the same site in 2012. Meanwhile, we artificially increased pollinator abundance by hiring beehives only in 2011. Pollinator abundance as well as flower density significantly affected pollination of L. corniculatus plants from both the conspecific and interspecific plots. Total number of bees visiting a plot was enhanced by an increase in both the conspecific and interspecific flower densities regardless of high or low pollinator abundance. However, changes in visitation rates and fruit sets in the focal plants when flower densities were increased depended on pollinator abundance. Under high pollinator abundance, an increase in both the conspecific and interspecific flower densities significantly enhanced pollinator visits to L. corniculatus. However, under low pollinator abundance, the pollinator visitation rate remained unchanged as conspecific flower density increased, but decreased when there was an increase in interspecific flower density. Coflowering plants enhanced fruit sets of L. corniculatus only when the pollinator abundance was high. The findings suggest that the interactions among plants for pollination are influenced not only by a plant density threshold, but also by a pollinator abundance threshold.},

Cameras are typically set to take bursts of multiple photographs for each detection and are deployed in arrays of dozens or hundreds of sites, often resulting in millions of photographs per study. The task of converting photographs to animal detection records from such large image collections is daunting, and made worse by situations that generate copious empty pictures from false triggers (e.g., camera malfunction or moving vegetation) or pictures of humans. We developed computer vision algorithms to detect and classify moving objects to aid the first step of camera trap image filtering\textemdash separating the animal detections from the empty frames and pictures of humans. Our new work couples foreground object segmentation through background subtraction with deep learning classification to provide a fast and accurate scheme for human\textendash animal detection. We provide these programs as both Matlab GUI and command prompt developed with C++. The software reads folders of camera trap images and outputs images annotated with bounding boxes around moving objects and a text file summary of results. This software maintains high accuracy while reducing the execution time by 14 times. It takes about 6 seconds to process a sequence of ten frames (on a 2.6 GHZ CPU computer). For those cameras with excessive empty frames due to camera malfunction or blowing vegetation automatically removes 54\% of the false-triggers sequences without influencing the human/animal sequences. We achieve 99.58\% on image-level empty versus object classification of Serengeti dataset. We offer the first computer vision tool for processing camera trap images providing substantial time savings for processing large image datasets, thus improving our ability to monitor wildlife across large scales with camera traps.},

The behaviour of female owls was monitored by a camera system from hatching to fledging at 12 nests in 2004 and 2006 in the Ore Mountains, Czech Republic. Food abundance and reproductive success (the latter measured at the end of female's attendance of the brood) were higher in 2004 than in 2006. Females remained for a significantly longer time with their nestlings at the nests in 2004 (24.8 {$\pm$} 2.4 days) than in 2006 (22.2 {$\pm$} 0.9 days). During the attendance period, they were leaving the nest for several short trips each night; the duration of these trips, the total time spent outside the nest per night, and the number of trips per night did not differ between years. However, these variables did increase with increasing age of the young (though the number of trips per night increased only during the last week of the females' stay on the nests). Two types of female parental strategies were recorded after the end of brood attendance period: in 2004 when food was abundant, most of the females left their broods, whereas in 2006 when food was scarce, most of the females continued parental care and took part in the feeding of nestlings. The reproductive success was correlated negatively with both the total number of prey items and the proportional contribution of the females to nestling feeding. These results support the hypothesis that if the ecological conditions are such that the offspring can be raised by a single parent, its mate may abandon the clutch or brood and increase its fitness by sequential polygamy (polyandry/polygyny) during a single breeding season.},

  abstract = {The effects of elevated carbon dioxide on plant\textendash herbivore interactions have been summarized in a number of narrative reviews and metaanalyses, while accompanying elevation of temperature has not received sufficient attention. The goal of our study is to search, by means of metaanalysis, for a general pattern in responses of herbivores, and plant characteristics important for herbivores, to simultaneous experimental increase of carbon dioxide and temperature (ECET) in comparison with both ambient conditions and responses to elevated CO2 (EC) and temperature (ET) applied separately. Our database includes 42 papers describing studies of 31 plant species and seven herbivore species. Nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio in plants decreased under both EC and ECET treatments, whereas ET had no significant effect. Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates and phenolics increased in EC, decreased in ET and did not change in ECET treatments, whereas terpenes did not respond to EC but increased in both ET and ECET; leaf toughness increased in both EC and ECET. Responses of defensive secondary compounds to treatments differed between woody and green tissues as well as between gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Insect herbivore performance was adversely affected by EC, favoured by ET, and not modified by ECET. Our analysis allowed to distinguish three types of relationships between CO2 and temperature elevation: (1) responses to EC do not depend on temperature (nitrogen, C/N, leaf toughness, phenolics in angiosperm leaves), (2) responses to EC are mitigated by ET (sugars and starch, terpenes in needles of gymnosperms, insect performance) and (3) effects emerge only under ECET (nitrogen in gymnosperms, and phenolics and terpenes in woody tissues). This result indicates that conclusions of CO2 elevation studies cannot be directly extrapolated to a more realistic climate change scenario. The predicted negative effects of CO2 elevation on herbivores are likely to be mitigated by temperature increase.},
