## Automating image processing using CNNs, and exploring the tradeoffs of automation

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how deep learning methods can automate the processing of imagery data, and in dong so, open up new opportunities for inference. To do this, we use data generated by a long-term monitoring program that installs cameras at Peregrine Falcon breeding locations in the Canadian Arctic. Depending on the number of active nests, the program captures roughly 2.5 million images yearly, and manually classifying each image is impossible without investing substantial resources. As a result, a small subset of images that capture discrete events of interest (nestling hatching, provisioning, etc.) are processed from each year, and much of the data is archived in an un-usable format.


Here, we build a CNN capable of accurately detecting four main classes: **Peregrine adults**, **nestlings**, **eggs**, and **leg bands** (aluminum and Acraft separately) within each image. In doing so, we efficiently generate time-series data from each year that can be modeled to gain inference about breeding behaviour and demography.

## Status
On-going.

CNN has been trained and is achieving 97% accuracy with adults, 92% accuracy with eggs, and band classes. Nestlings are more difficult (currently at 75%), see below. Nestling inaccuracies likely stem from human error during annotation. When shown random images containing nestlings, it's often very difficult to differentiate individuals in the image due to overexposure, and the CNN is therefore being trained on an imperfect dataset. I suspect the accuracy of the CNN is similar to the accuracy of a human randomly classifying nest images, I'm working on confirming that.

### Brood size

#### Problem
Currently, the yolo estimation of chicks isn't accurate. This has to do with the fact that nestlings huddle together and appear as a white overexposed blob in the middle of the picture. I don't think a human could do better, but when humans evaluate images, we have the benefit of using information from previous images / nest visits. For example, if we know there were three distinct nestlings in an image from earlier in the day, and there's been no indication that a nestling has died since, we "smooth" the nestling counts in our mind and assume the white overexplosed blob of nestlings is in fact three individuals. Yolo doesn't have that luxury, since it has to provide us with data for each image independantly. For example:

  <img src="documents/b_size.png" width="900" />
</p>

The true brood size is drawn in black, with model predictions in red. The model predicts varying brood sizes across pictures according to how clumped together the nestlings are. The "confidence", as defined in this figure, is determined by the proportion of predictions for each brood size in a given day. so if there is a 75% confidence of a brood size of 2, that means two nestlings were detected in 75% of the images from that particular day.

### Solutions

 - **Option 1** - 
Retrain using object tracking. This would smooth the prediction across images by integrating something like deepsort via tensorflow. See [this repo](https://github.com/GeekAlexis/FastMOT), or [this one](https://github.com/LeonLok/Deep-SORT-YOLOv4) for examples. One issue with this method stems from the fact that we're not actually using video, or high frame rates. There are large gaps in the sequence of images, which introduces potential bias in tracking individuals. 

 - **Option 2** - 
Build a model that corrects predictions according to data obtained during nest visits. Use an observation confirmation model from [Chambert et. al 2015](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1890/14-1507.1)

 -  **Option 3** - 
Binarize nestlings. Many nest-fate models do this anyways, and incorporate broad categories such as brood initiation / brood failure / brood success.

-  **Option 4** - 
Implement a multievent model. Detecting nestlings on camera fits well with a mark-recap framework, and if we can successfully inject measurement error into the recaps, we could potentially automate the whole process (idea inspired by [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-011-0723-0))
